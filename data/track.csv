Doubt your fire Could

Centrefold
Like she made of gold
Batter up
Baddest babe
bout to roll in
Anytime
Anywhere
She makes your swagger
Take a second look
Then disappear

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Chorus x2
Its the number 2 killer
Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer
Well my body gonna need a moment

Second Verse
Many men
Think they better than
Miss in your face
Doubt your fire Could
last a match

Anytime
Anywhere

She'll take you on
Take a second
take apart your flair

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Its the, its the number 2 killer Hyah
Its the, its the number 2 kia Kia
Its the, its the number 2 killer Hyah
Its the, its the number 2 kia Kia

And thats whats left

Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer
Well my body gonna need a moment

Many men
Think they better than
Miss in your face
Doubt your fire Could
last a match

Anytime
Anywhere

She'll take you on
Take a second
take apart your flair

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,

""British ambient band Marconi Union has drummed up the world's most relaxing song: Weightless is 8 mins 10 sec. of aural bliss"" - Time Magazine, Best Inventions of the Year. 

""An excellent compilation from the always interesting Just Music"" - The Sunday Times

""The Ambient Zone is an album that feels like the world is peeling away, layer by layer, into multi-colored panoramas, just for you"" - Echoes (CD of The Month)

The Ambient Zone is a beautiful journey into ambient and electronica inspired by universal themes of calmness, purity, relaxation and enrichment where Weightless is coupled with some exclusive first releases and other blissfully ambient tracks from Just Music artists and alumni.

Created instinctively and intuitively by Marconi Union, Weightless has been claimed to have therapeutic properties in the way the track almost appears to have a heartbeat running through it which slows down very gently throughout the piece, encouraging a deep sense of relaxation in the body, It's use of specific rhythms, beep bass tones, frequencies and intervals induce an almost trance like state in the listener.

p.s. Lyrics! (requested by @vanillacaterpillar ) ~~~

Stay with me, my morning dew
Won't you be my love?
I need all you're givin me
It's you, oh you I'm dreamin of

All day long I'm day dreamin
Lookin out the window at the sun
In my tiny mind, I'm hiding out
Thinkin bout my lovely little one

In the time I spend with my head up in space, man
I am thinkin of your face
And when the morning sunlight brightens up my basement
I can feel your warm embrace

Since the day my love was born,
He was bound to come my way
Now he's here and here to stay,
Right until my dying day

In the time I spend with my head up in space, man
I am thinkin of your face
And when the morning sunlight brightens up my basement
I can feel your warm embrace,
Lover.

Hold my hand feel my love 
But understand it's all just luck 
No such thing as true love 
Its all just luck, Lucky Love 

But that don't make love weak, it's unique 
The chances that we'd meet and just speak 
A million ways they give just to live 
And i'm just lucky this is it, this is it. 

Plant your feet, take this dance

@nymano is back with a solo album: Mirage. Full of numerous collaborators and instrumentalists, including @pandrezz and @iamjsan, @philanthrope1 and @sadtoi, Mirage is a twelve-song project of reflection of growth. Meditation and change. It's an audible journey of loss, misdirection, guidance, and finding one's way.

In his own words: ""Mirage is something that we hope to see existing in the distance, that we try to reach as best we can, but which in the end doesn‚Äôt exist. This album is about a mirage that I could see.""

I like to think I‚Äôm well-equipped as any other average guy 
but I just can‚Äôt discover love and I don‚Äôt even set my standards high
on top of that, I‚Äôm camera shy, maybe I should opt-out of the dating pool
and be an undercover tinder samurai

cause I would rather type online than whisper in a dingy bar
and swiping left and right could be my new bushido ninja star
and I‚Äôm well-versed in virtual lovemaking ninjutsu 
on every profile pic I post, I‚Äôm posing with my shitzu
or flexing with my shirt off cause I heard that gets you hits too

Especially OkCupid, I‚Äôm like Eros or the cherubs be,
I pierce hearts of women with my cursor and my arrow keys
and disregard my Roman roots and choose a font that‚Äôs serif-free,

trust me,

 I‚Äôm a tinder bio brainiac
the way I kindle fire with matches, I‚Äôm a pyromaniac
on christian mingle, I‚Äôm a casanova,
if ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt think so, y‚Äôall can ask Jehovah
check your inbox, he might send an answer over

I wish I had the muscles of a granite sculpture
I would log on ashleymadison and bang adulterers
I‚Äôm so lonely, I‚Äôve considered farmers-only
just for someone‚Äôs arms to hold me
also, I‚Äôm really big on agriculture

but if I had that body of a grecian god
I would trawl on pof.com and use it as a fishing rod
and hope I don‚Äôt get catfish,
the fact is if I did, I‚Äôd probably play along cause god knows I could use the practice,

and if I‚Äôm aching for my roots, I‚Äôd visit shaadi.com
message islamic wahhabi hijabi hotties ‚Äúsalaam‚Äù
and sunni, shia, those are both denominations I respect
cause I just care for our connection, 

I don‚Äôt care about the sects

sometimes I uninstall my apps in reckless insurrectious rage
and then regret it while I check the craiglist missed connections page
and then I think that I should get out more and disregard my mobile cell
and get to know the local teller at my barnes and noble well
and check out what she‚Äôs reading while she‚Äôs charging up my total sale
and ask her if she likes the novel,
and once she answers, ask her if wants to grab some coffee or some ice cream waffles,
and she‚Äôd probably say that‚Äôs awesome, 

 I‚Äôd ask her when she‚Äôs off of work,

 she might answer ‚Äúmidnight‚Äù

 I‚Äôd tell her that sounds awful, 

what a bummer, and from somewhere
I might muster up the nerve to get her number,

 and I would ask her what her digits are
and if I play it right then I can disregard my ninja stars, 
say sayonara to katanas and my other weapons too

Lyrics:

Quit Playing, I'm tired of playing games.
Always try to prove to you, but you I never receive the same.
All I want is you, just give me the time.
And baby if you don't, there won't be a next time.

What kind of love is this?
My heart hurts and I feel like dirt.
When you push me away, the only thing that's there is pain.

Don't you ever tell me you cared for me.",3.0,True,33.0,,288.0,https://soundcloud.com/casinocowboy/plastic,12603.0,31

Lyrics:

Hook

Dont stay awake for too long
Dont go to bed
Ill make a cup of coffee for your head
Ill get u up and going out of bed

v1
I don‚Äôt wanna fall asleep
I don‚Äôt wanna pass away
Thinking of r future cuz 
Ill never see those days

I don‚Äôt know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But u know that I‚Äôm not perfect

Ive been praying for forgiveness
you‚Äôve been praying for my health
when I leave this earth
Hoping you‚Äôll find somebody else

Cuz ya we still young
Theres so much we haven‚Äôt done
Getting married
Start a family
Watch ur husband with his son

I wish it could be me
But I won‚Äôt make it off this bed
Hope I go to heaven so I see u once again

Ya my life was kind of short
But I got so many blessings
happy u were mine 
it sucks that its all ending

v2
Im happy that u here w me
Sorry if I tear up
When me and u were younger
U would always make me cheer up

taking goofy videos
And walking through the park
U would jump into my arms 
Every time u heard a bark

We would cuddle in your sheets
Sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays go to church
Mondays watch a movie
soon you‚Äôll be alone
Sorry that u have to loose me",33310.0,False,0.0,Lofihiphop,841879.0,https://soundcloud.com/powfu/death-bed-prod-otterpop,54430687.0,26154

722309856,322194117,Elyon - Andante [Lo-fi],6415300,Elyon,"A friend and I were talking about ""Lo-fi"" hiphop genre and about how it's becoming ""popular"" again. I personally enjoy listening to this genre but never tried creating something in it. ""Lo-fi,"" meaning ""Low Fidelity,"" adds that ""gritty"" and ""low quality"" sound that used to be all around us in the 90's and before. Now days, everything's HQ or HD, we have CDs instead of cassette tapes or vinyls, DVD players or online streaming instead of VHS players. I had a warm fuzzy feeling inside as I was creating this. It reminded me of my childhood, back when everything was ""ordinary"" and ""innocent.""

The word andante simply means ""moderately slow tempo."" Time has been moving way too fast for me, lately. It's time to take a little breather and refresh. Looking back, though tough, I had a really nice and a blessing of a childhood. Something that I'll never be able to relive and experience. I have to thank God for always being there, guiding me. Though I forget His presence and though I sometimes lose track of where I'm suppose to go, He never failed to show me His grace and patient love. I wish I could be more loving and caring like Him. I wish I could be a better friend to my friends. I wish I could be a better person. But the day of sunrise is nigh. Thank you to everyone who's been talking to me and checking up on me. Thank you for even sending me some encouraging words regarding music or life. I appreciate every one of you guys, supporting me in my musical endeavors.

Lyrics:

Hook

Dont stay awake for too long
Dont go to bed
Ill make a cup of coffee for your head
Ill get u up and going out of bed

v1
I don‚Äôt wanna fall asleep
I don‚Äôt wanna pass away
Thinking of r future cuz 
Ill never see those days

I don‚Äôt know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But u know that I‚Äôm not perfect

Ive been praying for forgiveness
you‚Äôve been praying for my health
when I leave this earth
Hoping you‚Äôll find somebody else

Cuz ya we still young
Theres so much we haven‚Äôt done
Getting married
Start a family
Watch ur husband with his son

I wish it could be me
But I won‚Äôt make it off this bed
Hope I go to heaven so I see u once again

Ya my life was kind of short
But I got so many blessings
happy u were mine 
it sucks that its all ending

v2
Im happy that u here w me
Sorry if I tear up
When me and u were younger
U would always make me cheer up

taking goofy videos
And walking through the park
U would jump into my arms 
Every time u heard a bark

We would cuddle in your sheets
Sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays go to church
Mondays watch a movie
soon you‚Äôll be alone
Sorry that u have to loose me",33310.0,False,0.0,Lofihiphop,841879.0,https://soundcloud.com/powfu/death-bed-prod-otterpop,54430697.0,26154

JULY 2017, AMSTERDAM, NL

TO WHOM IT MAY CONERN: WHILE PATROLING THE FORBIDDEN FOREST LATE LAST NIGHT, WE CAPTURED A HUMAN-LIKE LIFEFORM THAT WE BELIEVE MAY BE EXTRA-TERRESTRIIAL IN ORIGIN. THE CREATURE, WHO WAS ABLE TO CONVERSE IN BOTH DUTCH AND ENGLISH, TOLD US HIS NAME WAS ‚ÄúDARLING‚Äù. WHEN WE DISCOVERED HIM, HE WAS CLEARLY DISOREINTED AND CHANTING THE LETTERS ‚ÄúJ‚Äù, ‚ÄúP‚Äù AND ‚ÄúS‚Äù.

IN HIS POSSESSIONS WE DISCOVERED A PLASTIC BOX INSCRIBED WITH THE ABOVE INITIALS AND A FLAT BLACK DISC STAMPED WITH THE CODE ST005. UNDER INTERROGATION, THE SUBJECT TOLD US THAT THE BOX WAS A ‚ÄúDRUM MACHINE‚Äù. IT HAD BEEN GIFTED TO HIM BY HIS GRANDFATHER, WHO WENT BY THE NAME ‚ÄúJOOP‚Äù. HE ADDED THAT MUSIC CREATED USING THIS DEVICE HAD BEEN ETCHED INTO THE SURFACE OF THE BLACK DISC.

HAVING FOUND A SUITABLE MACHINE TO EXTRACT THE MUSIC FROM WITHIN THE GROOVES, WE WERE ASTONISHED BY WHAT WE HEARD. THERE WERE SIX COMPOSITIONS ON WHICH THE SUBJECT‚ÄôS FAMILY ‚ÄúDRUM MACHINE‚Äù WAS PROMINENTLY FEATURED, REPLICATING PROGRAMMED ELECTRONIC RHYTHMS THAT SOUNDED ALIEN IN ORIGIN.

THE WARM AND LOOSE FEEL OF THESE PERCUSSIVE ELEMENTS WAS FURTHER ENHANCED BY THE SUBJECT‚ÄôS CHOICE OF ACCOMPANYING ELECTRONIC MUSICAL FEATURES. THESE FREQUENTLY CAUGHT OUR EAR AND ENHANCED OUR COLLECTIVE MOOD. THESE VARIOUSLY SOUNDED INTERGALACTIC, LOVED-UP, DREAMY, OTHERWORLDLY AND SOOTHING. ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES, WITHIN EARSHOT, SPONTANEOUSLY STARTED DANCING.

WE HAVE KEPT THE SUBJECT UNDER OBSERVATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO UNLESS WE RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY. IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THE MUSIC SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.",2.0,False,0.0,Dance,109.0,https://soundcloud.com/safe-trip/a3-darling-experience-06-50,6178.0,13

838359041,322194117,Elyon - Andante [Lo-fi],6415300,Elyon,"A friend and I were talking about ""Lo-fi"" hiphop genre and about how it's becoming ""popular"" again. I personally enjoy listening to this genre but never tried creating something in it. ""Lo-fi,"" meaning ""Low Fidelity,"" adds that ""gritty"" and ""low quality"" sound that used to be all around us in the 90's and before. Now days, everything's HQ or HD, we have CDs instead of cassette tapes or vinyls, DVD players or online streaming instead of VHS players. I had a warm fuzzy feeling inside as I was creating this. It reminded me of my childhood, back when everything was ""ordinary"" and ""innocent.""

The word andante simply means ""moderately slow tempo."" Time has been moving way too fast for me, lately. It's time to take a little breather and refresh. Looking back, though tough, I had a really nice and a blessing of a childhood. Something that I'll never be able to relive and experience. I have to thank God for always being there, guiding me. Though I forget His presence and though I sometimes lose track of where I'm suppose to go, He never failed to show me His grace and patient love. I wish I could be more loving and caring like Him. I wish I could be a better friend to my friends. I wish I could be a better person. But the day of sunrise is nigh. Thank you to everyone who's been talking to me and checking up on me. Thank you for even sending me some encouraging words regarding music or life. I appreciate every one of you guys, supporting me in my musical endeavors.

and he had... a mind like a great force
with eyes like a forecast, heart like a rainstorm
brainstorm problems with solutions in the same form
of course we're both talented, sweetie, that's what we aim for
perfect match, certified, heard him laugh, curtains wide
watching through the windows while my home was being burglarized
my home being my heart, and the windows being my hurting eyes
you ever met someone cute enough that you'd share your curly fries?
'cause i have... and i can say that truthfully
a demon from below, who'd have thought that an angel'd stoop to me?
see, i don't think god's out there, but i don't care what you believe
i will pray for you to be my darling 'til i lose my teeth
and age into a state that's far from happiness and jubilee
and stay up in the night until i'm growing used to losing sleep
if you're in my dreams, then i'll count sheep, wake up, hit snooze, repeat
and hope whoever's out there can grant the wish you've accrued in me for...

leave me buried 
by your lovely bones
they don't scare me
oh your lovely bones

leave me buried
all the creatures came to pray
put me in the earth
let the soil have its way
they don't scare . . . . .
(from the angel's strings)
why does time take all things?

it's long enough
oh this life, it's long enough

leave me buried 
by your lovely bones
they don't scare me
oh your lovely bones

and vibrant as usual

After launching late last year with an EP from Australian golden boy Mall Grab, @ShallNotFade has powered into prominence through a highly productive 2016.

Contours' (@tom-burford) contribution to the label, a four-track EP titled ‚ÄòLoose Wood‚Äô, marks another fine instalment to its impressive discography, featuring a Ross From Friends remix to round off the tracklist.

A tale about a foreigner who woke up in a mysterious land covered in mist.

As he was looking at his surroundings he bumped into a kid named Riku who had a broken wooden sword, Riku was excited because he'd never met a foreigner before. Riku later invited him to his home and the foreigner met his family but...this was no ordinary family as they were Samurais. 

As the foreigner peeked through the branchy hut he saw a dozen more just like Riku‚Äôs family, it was at that moment he realised he was in the Land of the Samurai.....

About College Music:
At College Music, we find and showcase the latest work from up and coming artists. Whether you're about to go out, having a party or just relaxing; we aim to represent something exciting, attractive and inviting. The name originated because a small group of friends while at college struggled to find music which had originality and didn't conform to the generic ""pop"" which was consistently released to the public. College Music is about new music from unheard artists and providing a platform for them to be heard by listeners like us. We firmly believe that a brand‚Äôs name, ethos, and content should all align together. For us, our name ties in perfectly.",47.0,False,0.0,,4078.0,https://soundcloud.com/collegemusicyt/afternoon,307591.0,98

the lives you lived?
the people you loved?
are you the type to
hide from a storm?
shut all the windows?
keep the bed warm?
are you the type to
hide from a storm?
shut the windows, 
keep the bed warm 

[everything fades away, 
it doesn't matter anyway ]

i‚Äôll be waiting outside
i saw that look in your eyes 
i'm not surprised
but why would you try
to keep something like that from me
i know this might be hard to believe but 
honesty, honestly,
would always be the best thing for me
i mean, even if you don‚Äôt have any feelings
just a human need for intimacy 
that would prolly be chill with me 
but first i'm gunna need some transparency 

[ cause i'm falling headfirst
i want to write you letters
i love you for your betters
and your worst ]

but if you don‚Äôt feel the same
promise it won't bother me
i'll just probably have to take a little break 
my mistake for falling 
so hard for you 
i should have thought this through
i guess i just like you a lot
i'm getting attached and that‚Äôs not what you want
take a deep breath
i'll keep your secrets
open the windows
just like when we met
i‚Äôll be alright
i‚Äôll be just fine
darling don‚Äôt hesitate
to illustrate what's on your mind

i‚Äôll be waiting outside
i saw that look in your eyes 
i‚Äôm not surprised
but why would you try
to keep something like that from me
i know dat dis might be hard to believe but 
honesty, honestly, honesty
is da best thing for me 
i mean if you don‚Äôt have

Korean born, Î∞ïÌòúÏßÑ park hye jin is a resident DJ at Pistil Dance Club, with regular broadcast performances on Seoul‚Äôs independent underground radio ‚ÄúSCR‚Äù. Her style blends elements of dream-state house, raw hip-hop & psychedelic darkwave and mixes her own English and Korean vocals over dreamy synths & thick beats for a forward-thinking dancefloor experience.

Title track IF U WANT IT, has park hye jin singing a duet with herself in Korean over a bangin 4/4 beat, followed rapidly by ABC which finds park croon in English over a smoky piano line before tumbling effortlessly into a motorik fashioned middle breakdown. From there we shift gears, sliding into the deep thunder of Korean vocaled I DON‚ÄôT CARE, the abyss of CLOSE EYES, before sailing endlessly into the moonlight on EP closer, CALL ME.

We are completely thrilled to present you this exciting underground talent coming out of Seoul.

Airplane Mode is what you want to listen to when you feel the need to disconnect and focus on self. Music inspires me; it gives me the ability to create, to dream, to focus and to relax. I like to get lost in the music I love without interruption from everything else that is going on. I've compiled a list of songs that do that for me and I've mixed them together. This mix is for the artist, the musician, the student, the traveler and anyone else who just wants to get away for a moment.

Once again we return with the last of our essentials compilation series for 2018. As this year draws to a close and we reflect on what has been an amazing 12 months for all those involved in the label, what better soundtrack for this time of grateful introspection than this release. During winter we often contemplate the hours, days and months in which we have experienced changes this past year, in both the seasons and our lives themselves. This 26 track journey through the warmest of sounds is bound to keep you warm throughout the coming weeks whatever the temperature of your surroundings; Come and chill with us.

Centrefold
Like she made of gold
Batter up
Baddest babe
bout to roll in
Anytime
Anywhere
She makes your swagger
Take a second look
Then disappear

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Chorus x2
Its the number 2 killer
Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer
Well my body gonna need a moment

Second Verse
Many men
Think they better than
Miss in your face
Doubt your fire Could
last a match

Anytime
Anywhere

She'll take you on
Take a second
take apart your flair

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Its the, its the number 2 killer Hyah
Its the, its the number 2 kia Kia
Its the, its the number 2 killer Hyah

lyrics:
laying alone, i dissociate 
laying alone 

i saw a pictureframe 
and it turned out to be a mirror 
my reflection's so much clearer 
when i'm not aware it's me 

i saw a maple tree 
it was growing in my head 
when everybody else was dead 
and i climbed up it just to see 

i saw myself again 
but i stood outside my being 
i could understand that being 
isn't all there is to be 

i see the future now 
got too distracted by the present 
to remember that my head is 
not a vehicle for fear 

and it's a long way down if you fall 
and it's a long way up if you don't 

and it's a long way down if you fall 
and it's a long way out, so 

i sit in the center 
and i ponder my disinterest 
for it all 

it's a lot easier 
to imagine ending things 
(to imagine ending things) 
when i'm watching myself 
from the third person 
(from the third person)

LYRICS:
we all got internet personas
internet personas we hide behind
we hide behind

we all got demons deep inside us
demons deep inside us we try to hide
we try to hide

i forgot who it is i truly am long ago
but i'll keep searching for it while i can

i knew a boy who could outline a shape in a second
that's display was eclectic in a way that was second to none
he had a hand than swam like fish in the seas
and a penstroke that'd bring any critic to his knees
it was beautiful, flowing like the blood inside my artieries
he painted hearts as targets and was practicing his archery
mastering the artistry he carried in his chest
until at best it was a godsend, and worst, it was a part of me
'til suddenly... things began to seem different
moods dissipated into blue and grey pigments
but surface-wise his screen names were never inefficient
as a method to communicate that happiness was with him
so a couple thousand people saw a perfectly inoccuous complexion
while i was tryna talk him through depression
the lesson to be learned is that your heros aren't invincible
just normal folks who often need expression, so pause and leave a message...

if you want; they'd probably appreciate it...

...internet personas
internet personas we hide behind
we hide behind

we all got demons deep inside us
demons deep inside that we try to hide
we try to hide

i forgot who it is i truly am long ago
but i'll keep searching for it while i can

i knew a person who could cultivate the words that they aligned
in a way that could coerce a train to fly
a perfect state of mind in which to learn creative rhymes
until their person was emburdened by the verses they designed
and they began to lose their touch...
the little quirks in all their writing became terse and uninviting
and ingesting any lettering they surgeoned into life
instead of being entertainment was inert and just absurd and all the work was fucking tiring
and suddenly... they were writing less and less
in spite of their success they saw no light and second guessed
the creativity they harbored in their heart
there's only so much fucking artwork you can make 'til you forget the way to start
so a couple million people saw some dipping in the frequency
of music while they fought idiosyncracy
that slept as mental illness... and woke as some peculiar train of thought
that masqueraded as a symptom of a hindering deliquency

i hope that all these words have made you think of me

455725254,304631748,broken record,66379717,atlas,"self-produced; this one's pretty cute 

guitar recorded on my fender tele 
drums from a few different sample packs

this is a sunny sky, this is a starry night 
this is an afternoon i'll spend inside your arms, held tight 
this is a question mark, this is a final thought 
this is a happy ending snuck into the epilogue 
this is a seperate building, this is the journey there 
this is the scenic route, this is your messy hair 
this is a promise kept, an honored lesson, taught it to you 
through the momunental light alive inside your amour suit, and... 
this is the reason i've been shaking when i speak 
always terribly afraid to make mistakes and make you leave 
it's a shame i'm scared of heights, 'cause when you sweep me off my feet 
i feel the ground beneath me start to sink into the sea 
i can feel the clouds above me coming closer to my touch 
i can almost taste the heavens, but compared to you, it's much 
the same as everything else... another book on a shelf 
it's just too hard to explain, so i'm repeating myself, like... 

this is a broken record, this is a broken record 
this is a broken record, you'll always know me better 
this is a broken record, this is a broken record 
this is a broken record, so i'll be yours forever 

this is the celebration, this is the party hat 
this is the cellophane in which my heart is wrapped 
and i'm peeling it back, 'cause i'm feeling the love 
this is absolute bliss, this can fit like a glove 
this is peace on the earth, this is me, what it's worth 
i'm not a hundred percent sure, but still 
this here, this is a final draft, this is an epitath 
for every negative emotion on a seperate path 
this is the safest feeling ever to be felt 
it's a message in the morning that intends to make you melt 
and honestly, this is my magnum opus, this is a story book 
where all the illustrations have super-friendly sorta look 
a cordial shook hand at an important event 
with stainless steel silverware and a porcelain dish 
it's the weight of the pull inside of a torrent of fish 
a metaphor used precisely to make it more than it is 

this is a broken record, this is a broken record 
this is a broken record, you'll always know me better 
this is a broken record, this is a broken record 
this is a broken record, so i'll be yours forever 

this is a broken record, this is a broken record 
this is a broken record, you'll always know me better 
this is a broken record, this is a broken record

The Saga continues : A group consisting of the best Samurais headed east to get revenge for their beloved childhood friend. 
As they arrived, they promptly met a group of mongols. A bloody fight was inevitable. Having advanced techniques and weapons, the Samurai didn't stand a single chance !
As the last Samurai tried to full fill his duty to die in honour by his own sword, Monguul grabbed his neck and strangled him to death. 
In unspeakable pleasure he looks down at the dead bodies and breaks out in laughter .....

love me like the songs you sing
love me like the light you bring
love me with your hand on my cheek

did you know you taught me to love who i was? 
you showed me that i healed my own bones
and you never grabbed me like others did
when the world yelled, you kissed my ears
just pull me in like a sunlight dream
and feel all the colors bloom under your feet

Lyrics:

Don't call me if you ain't already free
Guess it's usual these days and I should start to not believe
I've been tripping on my own two feet
You talking bout my problems like they don't involve me
Hardly, stick to running, when you take it slow you just forget to breathe
so busy glancing at the roses that you hardly felt the breeze
I see the heads of all your nails are painted softly with a t
And in my ignorance I slipped and asked exactly what it means
And you said, this is everything, the pinnacle of my belief
This paint is just a symbolism, god's the only one I need
If anything should happen, if anyone should make me bleed
I hold my hands together, pray to God that he would set them free

Raise your hands, hallelujah
Everybody singing out to God ""I always knew ya""
But I'mma keep it real I only came last week
The paranoia got to me and kept me feeling weak

We were talking bout the liquor and the money and the things that they were taking from me
How could I just say it's funny, talk about my tape is coming, sit across from Satan's cousin
I don't have to pay for nothing, why should I be fake for something
Who, told you I'm not giving it my all
They probably right, I quit the drink and got withdrawals
I hit the sink every night, now I reflect on what I've drawn
Not the brightest of lights, but I got something for the fall
Hol' up

Raise your hands, hallelujah
Everybody singing out to God ""I always knew ya""
But I'mma keep it real I only came last week
The paranoia got to me and kept me feeling weak",29.0,True,285.0,Hip-hop & Rap,1248.0,https://soundcloud.com/chriswright/hallelujah-prod-by-grei,109661.0,95

Centrefold
Like she made of gold
Batter up
Baddest babe
bout to roll in
Anytime
Anywhere
She makes your swagger
Take a second look
Then disappear

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Chorus x2
Its the number 2 killer
Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer
Well my body gonna need a moment

Second Verse
Many men
Think they better than
Miss in your face
Doubt your fire Could
last a match

Anytime
Anywhere

She'll take you on
Take a second
take apart your flair

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Its the, its the number 2 killer Hyah
Its the, its the number 2 kia Kia
Its the, its the number 2 killer Hyah
Its the, its the number 2 kia Kia

Chorus x2
Its the number 2 killer
Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer

LYRICS:
i'm sick of trembling in fear at the idea of death
since it's always on my mind i just hide in my bed
""everybody's scared of it"" is what my therapist said
but my case seems worse, when i've barely been fed

because the kitchen's too far to desire the steps
it'd take to make it down the stairs and try to find a baguette
or something similar that wouldn't make my stomach upset
it doesn't feel like this is real, yeah, my mind is a mess

the only times it seems clear is when music is played
some relatable creator says i'll soon be okay
or when reading poetry trying to soothe the dismay
and i can lose my insecurities in cute little sayings, like

""why frown when the sun goes down,
if you'll wake in the morning to such nice sounds
when the nighttime creeps, well your eyes might weep
but that's just moonlight tryna find nice people""

""why frown when the sun comes 'round
even if you feel shaken or upside down
when the daytime hits, you'll be great, my friend
just make it through this, just make it through this""

""why frown when the sun comes 'round
even if you feel shaken or upside down
when the daytime hits, you'll be great, my friend
just make it through this, you can make it through this""",461.0,False,0.0,Hip-hop & Rap,33310.0,https://soundcloud.com/atlas/suchnicesounds,3134114.0,2102

lyrics: 

i‚Äôve been so caught up in my life,
can you kiss me,
i‚Äôm running out of time.
lately i‚Äôm lost,
lately i fall,
and lately i can‚Äôt get a text, or a call.
i thought you would call,
my feelings involved.
but you slipped away,
so we can‚Äôt have it all.

i told you that i needed space,
you let it dissolve.
and now i‚Äôm a wasted face 
with no name at all.
so just let me drink,
and let me get high,
to numb all the pain that i feel from your eyes.
i know that you‚Äôre hurt,
i know that you cry,
i know that the sadness will never subside.
but you‚Äôll be alright,
my feelings aside,
i‚Äôll take care of you as if you were my pride.
& i‚Äôll wrap you up,
and make sure you‚Äôre loved,
and show you that pain is a thought,
not a drug.",48.0,True,53.0,acoustic lofi,1302.0,https://soundcloud.com/escapeivan/boyinblue,104104.0,45

Listen to this raspy voice, yeah it‚Äôs the sound of cigarettes,
Can you hear my crappy choices by the pound, wrapped up with my regrets,
And can you hear my passed joys come out with what I express,
And are my words a vessel for all the things that I confess.

And what would you do, if I was deaf and mute,
And I had just a few, little dots to speak through.
Put them dots on the wall, if my message still was tall,
Would you answer to it‚Äôs call, would you read it till‚Äô it falls.
No‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶I‚Äôm lucky to be in the position I am,
Lucky to carry out all of my plans,
Lucky to be able to understand you.
Lucky that English is spoke in Japan,
Lucky that I benefit from my land‚Äôs -
Past horrors, I don‚Äôt need to understand you

And every voice is different,
No such thing, as indifference,
The problem isn‚Äôt distance,
It‚Äôs just that no one will listen.
Because we all deserve the same,
Different pride, different plain,
Different lies, different names,
But we all, suffer pain. (yeah)

Listen to this raspy voice, yeah it‚Äôs the sound of cigarettes,
Can you hear my crappy choices by the pound, wrapped up with my regrets,
And can you hear my passed joys come out with what I express,

Who will sing my love fast to sleep
Magazine rip my past to pieces
Ash it out, we ain‚Äôt passing weed
Trynna leave but I‚Äôm trapped in leases
Masterpiece is all I can settle for
Chain around my neck, pushing pedals more
Scared of silence so it‚Äôs always getting torn
Movie nights with a bag of kettle corn
Why is it my words that you listen to
Signals passing through simple tubes
Playin out into empty rooms
Cause on my side, I can‚Äôt hear bout all the things that are wrong
Yeah on my side, couldn‚Äôt ever find peace in one of my songs
Still on my side, you should not feel like we would ever get along

As the sun finally burrows its way into bed, you leave Ji-eun's apartment, finding the empty street outside lost in mist. You know your way back home but you don't take it. 

Throughout the city you find velvet gardens draped in the colors of nearby shop windows and cafes. The tender stare of a stranger, their face illuminated by phone light from below and street lamps from above. The steps you take start to melt into one another, softly being enveloped by some unknown force that carries you forward. 

The night blooms further, the light becomes more and more neon. The skyline turns obsidian and the same old doubts replay in your head. But the momentum of something greater than yourself pushes you forward. Into and then back out of the lights of different entrances, effecting your egress into the night over and over again. 

You lose track of time, slipping into ash filled streets farther from the center of the city. Outskirts where all color has been lost save for the silver rain of moonlight. An empty palette, a lake of mercury and ash, obsidian and velvet. Would any life have been lived the same as yours, City Girl?

It's the most wanted
most hated
most haunted
boys that paid the cost
slowly dying but I'm flossing
looking good, ain't he?
boy bounced back from the dead
my business still shady
I still tip toe on the ledge
that shit ain't ever changing
I take my chance riding dirty while speeding
lane swanging
I fucking made it to 30 without my neck breaking
my gun that's holding a 30 that got his legs shaking
meanwhile his girl in the room with my picture masterbating
slowly crawling out the dirt
when it comes to death I like to flirt
my hills have eyes and a smirk
my cuz got blues and he got that syrup, boy

[VERSE II: Duck Boy]

If I keep it up, all these 30s gonna kill me before 30
another day wasted up my nose and it's still early
don't you worry
i'm always in a hurry
so i copped a foreign coupe
riding around town 'til i got to pull up to the court at noon
snort another blue
now i'm feeling sorta blue
nothing new
one of the chosen few
the rest of yall give him some room
it's best if yall didnt assume that he was destined for imminent doom
unless he is ready to get in the tomb
ruby such a bum but he make it look good
trunk in the front
yeah, that's what's under the hood

booked a first class flight
fly me anywhere
making sure it's somewhere far away
awake me when we land
I never thought that I would be a millionaire
never in my life
on the verge of suicide
I told the world ""It's you or I""
I have two sides
one that wants to see you all thrive
and one that wants to see you die
fancy cars and clothes homes
wrecked and abandoned
now you're regretting that loan
money on my mind
i lost track of time
tried to spend it all in one night
now i'm broke until i've died

{VERSE II: Anthony Mars]

came home late night
hugging on my parents tight
told me that they missed me
followed by another fight
wait
Facebook, Gram likes
how you doing on the mic?
how you doing on the road?
I ain't trying to tour no more

rotten on the inside

been dead for years no need to slit

sometimes i just need that drip

February 7th is Nujabes' and J Dilla's birthday. These 2 artists have largely inspired today's sound of both Aso and Chillhop. With this EP (""Two / Seven"" signifying February 7th), we want to pay tribute to artists who largely laid the foundation of what we are doing today. While Dilla and Nujabes are no longer with us, they live on through the sounds of artists and people inspired by their music. We hope you enjoy these tracks.

Lyrics:

The evil that I hold inside
Bed of nails on which I lie
I made it
There's nowhere left for me to hide
Racing towards the other side
I hate it

All of my ranting and raving
I'm waxing and waning
And I don't see an end in sight
Maybe I'm just masquerading 
As way beyond saving
So I don't even have to fight

So cold to live without a soul
But I do my best to make things right
I roll deeper down the hole
I've been holding on with all my might

But in spite of my trying, I feel like I'm dying
And I can't hear a word you say
All of the drinking and lying, the games that I play
Nothing seems to make me feel OK

I think I'm running out of time
All I seem to leave behind's destruction
I can't undo what I have signed
It's no way to take back time
I loved them

Nobody wanted to find me 
A way back to guide me
Kept feeling like I wasn't right
Maybe I'm encapsulating
Somebody else saving
You really need to just sit tight

So cold to live without a soul
But I do my best to make things right
Alone without a heart or home
No one else can see it's fight or flight

Because they're trying to hide me
I feel like I'm blinding
Or was I never in their sight
No one's rewinding the time here
I'm left alone trying
Nothing seems to make me feel OK",169.0,False,0.0,Future Grunge,15504.0,https://soundcloud.com/8graves/ok-1,1003535.0,456

Lyrics:
I didn't mean to hurt you
When I hurt myself
It's just an empty voice screaming out for help
No I didn't mean to scare you
But I couldn't see
That when I went to hell I was taking you with me

When I close my eyes
I'm climbing in the dark
Trying not to fall apart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
and I don't wanna take you down with me

(Take you down
Take you down with me)

This life is like a razor
When it cuts I bleed
But it's in my hand and I'm doin' it to me
Sometimes it's like an ocean
And it gets too deep
There's no way now you could rescue me

When I close my eyes
I'm fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don't wanna take you down with me

You need to let it go now
Before you drown
I know that you won't understand
But you need to let go of this hand
Cause I'm going down
And I don't wanna take you down with me

Letter:

Yo Fam,

I've been wanting to share something super personal for a while and just wasn't exactly sure how to do it. I'm at the point now where I've heard countless stories from you. Some of you have said my music changed your life, helped you through depression, addiction, a lost loved one, the list goes on. Honestly, I feel bad because you don't know how much that truly means to me, because I've been there too... In the depths.

Six years ago I overdosed on heroin. I struggled with opiate addiction from a young age. I was trapped in it, had no passion, no direction, and truly hated myself. It was such a dark time for me and my family because when it gets bad enough, hope begins to dim and there's no escaping reality. I'm not telling you to preach or say how I found some magical cure or that everyone needs to live like I do. I'm the biggest advocate for people living their own lives and spreading their own love in their own ways. I'm just sharing my story and relating because music saved my life too. With everything that has been going on with my career, I always keep reminding myself of that. My main goal with music is to try and help people overcome their struggles and also enjoy the moment.

With all that said , 'Take You Down' is about my struggles with addiction and what it can do to families and loved ones. It's more specifically about my mom, and how no matter what, she never gave up on me and always continued to see the good even though all I was doing was messing up. To anyone struggling like I did, not just with addiction but anything in life, I hope you guys can find peace in your struggles and know that anything can be overcome. I've been clean since that overdose and I owe that to finding my passion and being surrounded by the most loving people I could ever ask for. Thank you for always listening and being open. Thank you for sharing your own stories and your love of music with me. Love you all forever :)",1137.0,False,0.0,Electronic,59963.0,https://soundcloud.com/illeniumofficial/illenium-take-you-down,3115747.0,7275

We were so bright standing in the sunlight
Never got burnt
We were alright, had that easy kind of love
And I let it in
For a moment, felt like we were floating
Baby, I swear, we were golden
It was easy, natural as breathing air
And when the sky went dark
You think I would have known before we let it get this far
I should have let you go
Now I gotta crawl outta love
Now I gotta crawl outta love
It's so fucking easy to fall in
But now that I see what you promised
Tell me how to crawl outta love
Tell me how to‚Äì
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
Tell me how to‚Äì
Now I gotta crawl outta, crawl outta love
Got your words right
Always knew what to say in our fights
Look at us now, hard as I try
I get halfway up the wall and you pull me down

'Shake Dat All Nite Long' has a Wu-Tang vibe with looped Jazzy synths, a swinging Hip Hop break underpinning the 4x4 kicks and Jungle Brothers samples. 'Grandfather Jazz Thing' goes even deper into the record crates of 90s Rap to dig out some smoke filled horns and Gangsta Rap vocal refrains that put extra bang in the beats. Hip House for 2019!

hopefully you can enjoy and relax to this one... if you want to talk about anything, just drop me a msg..

Catalog: INNER062
Format: 2x Tape Set 
Each tape is approx. 100min run time.

In an effort to try to do some good in the world, we gathered the fam to put together a mega compilation in order to raise some money to help people in Syria. 100% of proceeds will be donated to help support the White Helmets, people dedicated to saving lives affected by the ongoing war. 

Hosted by Inner Ocean Records + O-NEI-RIC Tapes + Saikei Collective, we gathered 109 lofi tracks from 109 different artists. The compilation spans 2 fully loaded tapes with approximately 100 minutes per tape, totalling almost 4 hrs of super chilled beats.

""a deep. wistful, nostalgic sense of longing for home; a yearning grief for people and things long gone""

Well there we go, another EP :)! This one is a bit different than the last one, its not lofi, its not rly hiphopbeatthingwhateveryouwannacallit, its more subtle, more ambient and melancholic I guess. It's more of a personal album, as it does showcase some different emotional stages that I have gone through in the last couple of months, it has been a rollercoaster and it still kind of is, but oh well.
In any case, hope you enjoy these tracks. And I hope they appeal to a larger audience, and I especially hope that some people can relate to these tracks, and maybe even find some sort of comfort in at least one of them. PEACEEEEEEE

Tracklist:

01 - ikigai
02 - a moment of silence
03 - petrichor
04 - another perspective
05 - interstellar brownies
06 - phosphenes
07 - sweven
08 - ukiyo
09 - falling asleep at 3:37am 
10 - ilia's dream

Hai there,
new EP is finally out. A bit different than my old 'usual' stuff, decided to try some new stuff a bit. I don't really want people to label my music as sad/despressive ahah.
In any case, I hope you enjoy this, it's hard to top 'hiraeth' imo, but oh well.
Thank you for listening to my music. Means a lot to me <3

Its been like
3 months of no talking
Walking by myself
No more eyes to get lost In
Keep on looking back all the time 
Ill be honest
I hate being alone
at least I got my conscience
Since u left me here
locked up in my room
writing all these songs
Wake up evey morning 
and turn my computer on
Because how else do I deal 
With these thoughts of u and me
I was on the clouds
Now im spiralling into sea
I wrote a message for u
But I couldn‚Äôt send it
I regret it
Yuh
Im sorry I‚Äôm pathetic
Whats this caught a sickness
and won‚Äôt be getting better
The sun might be shining
But it feels like rainy weather


Pre chorus
I trynna keep it on the low
I trynna get u off my mind
I trynna keep my feelings inside
But its hard sometimes


Chorus
I thought with u it might work out
But I guess I was wrong again
Im not sure what it is with me
I‚Äôve never been good with friends
I thought with u it might work out
But I guess I was wrong again
it doesnt matter who u are
Soon we‚Äôll come to the end


V2
Its been about a year
Since we last spoke
Trynna stay clean but need more soap
letting out pain with these words I wrote
Dried up tears and a bit of soar throat
feelings that had were beginning to rot
Starts off good then it suddenly stops
Ya but ill leave it in the past
Now the futures all I got


Bridge
All of these girls, they got me picking sides
Falling in love is like my kryptonite
Don‚Äôt know what to do 
No I can‚Äôt decide

((lyrics!))

you know that 
true love ain't an app
or swiping left
then swiping right
cuz she was just your type

super like
cuz you seemed fly
had a nice job
wasn‚Äôt too old
and had no ex wife

oOoOoOo tinder, you've got me fucked up
oOoOoOoOOOo tinder, you've got me out of luck
oOoOOOOOoOoo tinder, you've got me fucked up
OooOoo tinder, you've got me soo stuck

i‚Äôll message you
try to see through
your hashtag selfies
but they‚Äôre boring
you‚Äôre a average dude

i need to 
get in the mood
of being in love
but it is so hard
i‚Äôve got attitude

i cannot hide 
what is on my mind
but i can see if 
you could be my 
real life kind of guy

oOoOoOo tinder, you've got me fucked up
oOoOoOoOOOo tinder, you've got me out of luck
oOoOOOOOoOoo tinder, you've got me fucked up
OooOoo tinder, you've got me soo stuck

i‚Äôll be downtown
at the coffee shop
sitting in the corner
he would sit with me and stop

to talk to me
like a human being
instead of text
""i think you‚Äôre pretty,
you seem interesting""

oh my gosh
we would hit it off
who would have thought
i could meet him
he is such a boss 

...i feel so lame
cuz i don‚Äôt know his name
and in the end
this app just made me go fuckin' insane

oOoOoOo tinder, you've got me fucked up
oOoOoOoOOOo tinder, you've got me out of luck
oOoOOOOOoOoo tinder, you've got me fucked up
OooOoo tinder, you've got me soo stuck

i'm soOo stuck

i need to not pick up my phone

i can be a little bit cold

i‚Äôve been wishin that i was next to you
i've been dreaming of us

but

this year all i've got to show are songs
and i want to be 
super duper true
to you 
but god i don‚Äôt know what to do
cuz last year i was just 22
feels like it up and flew
so far away and out of view
but 23 seems like me and you  

cuz
i‚Äôve been dreaming bout you
i‚Äôve been wishin i was next to you
i‚Äôve been dreaming of us
i‚Äôve been thinking this is not a need or a must

i know sometimes i make you feel insane
i'm sorry thats just how i play this stupid game
i can't act like a child and disobey
all that you want from me and that you say
im sorrryyyyy baby
pleeeese puppy 
i‚Äôm trying to be
ultra mega happy
and show you my smile 
and send you my feelings 
and fuck - it is so hard 
being so damn far
i guess i‚Äôll just stay here 
and..
stay singing in my car?
(i'll sing in my car)

i‚Äôve been dreaming bout you
i‚Äôve been wishin i was next to you
i‚Äôve been dreaming of us
i‚Äôve been thinking this is not a need or a must

but
i've been waiting on you
i've been waiting for you to tell me those three words too

i've been hoping it's true

Suggested from Martin <3

Lyrics:

Hook

Dont stay awake for too long
Dont go to bed
Ill make a cup of coffee for your head
Ill get u up and going out of bed

v1
I don‚Äôt wanna fall asleep
I don‚Äôt wanna pass away
Thinking of r future cuz 
Ill never see those days

I don‚Äôt know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But u know that I‚Äôm not perfect

Ive been praying for forgiveness
you‚Äôve been praying for my health
when I leave this earth
Hoping you‚Äôll find somebody else

Cuz ya we still young
Theres so much we haven‚Äôt done
Getting married
Start a family
Watch ur husband with his son

I wish it could be me
But I won‚Äôt make it off this bed
Hope I go to heaven so I see u once again

Ya my life was kind of short
But I got so many blessings
happy u were mine 
it sucks that its all ending

v2
Im happy that u here w me
Sorry if I tear up
When me and u were younger
U would always make me cheer up

taking goofy videos
And walking through the park
U would jump into my arms 
Every time u heard a bark

We would cuddle in your sheets
Sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays go to church
Mondays watch a movie
soon you‚Äôll be alone
Sorry that u have to loose me",33310.0,False,0.0,Lofihiphop,841880.0,https://soundcloud.com/powfu/death-bed-prod-otterpop,54430703.0,26154

i've been movin' mountains pushin' through the snow
i can't feel my fingers, i can't feel my toes
love won't be my savior. i should let it go

shes got these eyes, jaded she's a gem
i might fall in love, i might break my heart again
love it when she laughs fuck i love it when she breaths
i get dizzy when she speaks cause she's exactly what i need

and i don't wanna waste your time
i just wanna give you mine
and i don't wanna waste your time
i just wanna give you mine

i think it might be best for me to let you go
but if you ever love me you should let me know
i know you really want him guess i'm fine with that
be careful with your heart cause i'm not good at that

picking up the pieces, 
does he hold you while you're sleepin?
heard he loves you does he mean it?
does he care about your dreams and
all your goals and how you'll meet em
does he call you ever evening
is he making sure you're eating
do you love him how he loves you is it even fucking even

i won't wait around for him to break your heart
i can't mend your soul i don't know where i'd start
i don't wanna fight again i know it gets hard

After various previous musical excavations with Chillhop, we bring these two Netherlands based artists to center stage. Dontcry & Nokiaa's first EP explores an intimate electronic soundscape whilst never straying too far from the relaxed origins we love to provide. 'Stray' is often a concept associated with being lost; rest assured this duos' four-track offering is firmly grounded in the spirit of sonic adventure.

Like spring days in April
And so the story begins

22 years it took me
When it hit it just shook me
Dome rattled up like a cage
It's 4AM and I'm burning sage
Just tryna wrap my head around it
Am I good enough yeah I doubt it
Puffing weed just to get around it
Meditating cause you know I'm about it I'm

Living life so free
Won't you join me

Now I state my intentions and say that I'm grateful
Born from the earth, what you think that I came for?
Brothers and sisters if you're at all able
Let your light shine, like spring days in April

Like spring days in April

I sip the liquor but it's much too harsh 
Chase me down chase me down make it stop
I know she said that she fuck with a old soul 
Unfortunate cause I sold mine to the devil for this mojo
She think it's just the soco
But she make my breath stop like she the centerfold, well
I've been searching for something sweet
That's cool in the summer to take away this heat
Vanilla coke she much too bland
The lime try too hard chasing all the other men well
I'm just searching for classic and timeless
Oh hey there, I think I found it

She my cherry cola
She g'on keep me sober
Let me keep you closer
Bubbly like a soda
Sweeter than the champagne 
Smoother than this Coltrane
Keep me from the chardonnay 
I'm just sippin' one thang (x2)

If it's not you then if won't do
If it's not you then if won't do 
If it's not you then it won't doooo

Before you I was drowning
Way deep in this fountain
Pull me to the surface

Sweet like that sugar cane
I'm so glad that you came
No clouds in my sky 
Cause she bring that sunshine 
Hold me down hold me down hold me down
Don't let me drown Don't let me drown

She my cherry cola
She g'on keep me sober
Let me keep you closer

Bandcamp: https://ginji.bandcamp.com/album/between-nothing

I have looked forward to releasing this for quite some time now. It‚Äôs been a dream of mine to make this project a reality since I was 20. I remember listening to Nujabes for the first time and being floored by how beautiful and impacting the music was. That feeling carried me forward through a large part of my musical development throughout the years. This album stems from not only that feeling, but a lot of the ups and downs I‚Äôve had the past few years. All I could hope for, is that this album conveys some sense of enjoyment and comfort to those that listen. I put everything I have into this one.

Thank you immensely to everyone who has supported me through different endeavors. I appreciate you so much! <3

selfish 
i'm feelin' selfish
you got me feelin' helpless
and i just can't compete

breathless
chasin' you got me stressin' 
i'm evil baby reckless
all i want is you here with me

i see the way you look at her
i know thats what you feel
i thought that it was meant to be
but clearly you don't want me

you say three words 
they mean the world
but you just can't commit
i'd give my all to make you smile
but that just isn't it 

you got me feelin' selfish
but you couldn't care less
i'm so fucking jealous
am i being selfish

you got me feelin' selfish
but you couldn't care less
i'm so fucking jealous
am i being selfish

but broken hearts do awful things
and mine is damaged
the more it takes the more it aches
can't you understand

you got me feelin' selfish
but you couldn't care less
i'm so fucking jealous
am i being selfish

you got me feelin' selfish
but you couldn't care less
i'm so fucking jealous
am i being selfish

uh uh oh
do you wanna go
where the lights turn low
and there's nobody around
not at this hour baby

we ee ee
we could go see
what the world looks like
when you're next to me
and all of the people
are fast asleep baby

cus im feeling really happy
and there's tingles up my spine
yeah
i said you make me happy
and i wanna make you mine

i'm never getting over you
your heart's stuck like super glue
and 
i'm never letting go
nah nah

i'm never getting over you
your heart's stuck like super glue
and 
i'm never letting go

oo oo oo
do you feel it too
hurry up and say something
so i can be with you
i cannot wait
one more day baby

nah nah nah
won't you come around
let me fill your mind 
with all these wonders 
and these sounds
just close your eyes
and fall into mine baby

and i'm feeling full of laughter
don't think i've ever felt this way
yeah
cliche words aren't what i'm after
i just don't know how else i should say

i'm never getting over you
your heart's stuck like super glue

LYRICS:
i'm sick of trembling in fear at the idea of death
since it's always on my mind i just hide in my bed
""everybody's scared of it"" is what my therapist said
but my case seems worse, when i've barely been fed

because the kitchen's too far to desire the steps
it'd take to make it down the stairs and try to find a baguette
or something similar that wouldn't make my stomach upset
it doesn't feel like this is real, yeah, my mind is a mess

the only times it seems clear is when music is played
some relatable creator says i'll soon be okay
or when reading poetry trying to soothe the dismay
and i can lose my insecurities in cute little sayings, like

""why frown when the sun goes down,
if you'll wake in the morning to such nice sounds
when the nighttime creeps, well your eyes might weep
but that's just moonlight tryna find nice people""

""why frown when the sun comes 'round
even if you feel shaken or upside down
when the daytime hits, you'll be great, my friend
just make it through this, just make it through this""

Lyrics:

Hook

Dont stay awake for too long
Dont go to bed
Ill make a cup of coffee for your head
Ill get u up and going out of bed

v1
I don‚Äôt wanna fall asleep
I don‚Äôt wanna pass away
Thinking of r future cuz 
Ill never see those days

I don‚Äôt know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But u know that I‚Äôm not perfect

Ive been praying for forgiveness
you‚Äôve been praying for my health
when I leave this earth
Hoping you‚Äôll find somebody else

Cuz ya we still young
Theres so much we haven‚Äôt done
Getting married
Start a family
Watch ur husband with his son

I wish it could be me
But I won‚Äôt make it off this bed
Hope I go to heaven so I see u once again

Ya my life was kind of short
But I got so many blessings
happy u were mine 
it sucks that its all ending

v2
Im happy that u here w me
Sorry if I tear up
When me and u were younger
U would always make me cheer up

taking goofy videos
And walking through the park
U would jump into my arms 
Every time u heard a bark

We would cuddle in your sheets
Sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays go to church
Mondays watch a movie
soon you‚Äôll be alone
Sorry that u have to loose me",33310.0,False,0.0,Lofihiphop,841880.0,https://soundcloud.com/powfu/death-bed-prod-otterpop,54430706.0,26154

Lyrics:
Home
I hope I‚Äôm going home soon
Not sure if I told you
Goodbye last night

And I‚Äôm sick
I‚Äôm sick of losing friends here
I think
I might‚Äôve left them all behind

But at least I have you
But at least I have you
But at least I have you

But at least I have you
But at least I have you
But at least I have you

Lost
Not sure I wanna be found here
I‚Äôll call you when I get this noose untied

And I care
Even when nobody else does
I‚Äôll smile and watch my friends all wave goodbye

But at least I have you
But at least I have you
But at least I have you

(Chorus)
I know I'm worthless like the rest.
And your trust is just a test.
I fear what pain will come next.
I wish that I cared less.

I love to pretend that you love me.
That you love me.
That you love me.
I love to pretend that you fuck me.
That you fuck me.
That you fuck me.

(Verse)
I've been lost in a maze.
For about a thousand days.
Girl just look me in my face.
And tell me that I'm okay.

Trapped inside my thoughts not surprised.
Feeling sick to my stomach from the emotions I hide.
I'm such a fucking failure I wanna die.
Rumors about me made me lose all my pride.

I don't wanna go to sleep.
I've been making all these tracks but I'm ass at mixing.
So I get a shitty sound and everyone is sleeping.
I'm a mattress I deserve all of this why is it so hard to see.

(Chorus)
I know I'm worthless like the rest.
And your trust is just a test.
I fear what pain will come next.
I wish that I cared less.

lyrics:
i just want my hand held, i ain't talking gameboys
and i ain't been in magazines, but me and you can play, boy
i'm looking for the same joy, the same touch and smolder
that i get when i lay my head down on your shoulder
that's real... i always wanna know how you feel
you bring me out my great depressions, i think you're the new deal
i'm staring at you in the mirror like fucking blue steel
wide-eyed, smiling, i'm just tryna help your mood heal

so if there's anything that i can do
to help the weaker side of you
just lemme know and i can move
my schedule up and down

i'm sorry if i haven't been
the best at how i'm managing
the problems that i'm handling
my head was in the ground

and truly, it's a miracle
that you are even near me, whether
fruitless or endearing
i'll be happy you're around

and if you're feeling terrible,
your sicknesses unparalled,
your headache is unbearable,
just step into the sound

i don't mind at all
my ibuprofen and my tylenol
are yours at the sound of your sirens' call
'cause i ain't letting you hurt tonight at all
tonight at all

i don't mind at all
my ibuprofen and my tylenol
are yours at the sound of your sirens' call

okay i'm back from japan and i'm finally able to post the lyrics here and soon the chords too!! 

lyrics:
i'm startin to feel some sort of way
you give me goosebumps everyday
and when you look at me and smile
i wanna say 
i-i think you're okay??

your stupid face makes me insane
my heart feels like it's trapped up in cellophane
and everytime i try to unwrap the pain
i-i feel so ashamed

oh but you don't know how i feel mmhm
its like everyday i'm runnin uphill
why can't i just spit it out and tell you right now
that you're the one i want out loud

i guess i'll stop here
and not hint at all
that you're one i've fallen for
but if you ever think of me as anything more
i-i'll be here at your call <3",840.0,False,0.0,LOVEY DOVEY,12178.0,https://soundcloud.com/chevyha/uwu-demo,635517.0,503

Vinyl Only. Fresh from releases on the legendary Vibraphone and Robsoul labels, alongside their own long-running Bosconi imprint, Fabio Della Torre & Ennio Colaci aka Minimono join the Inner Balance family for an EP of four fine house dishes. Each cut gives us a different taste of classic house, from the sharp Melchior shuffle of 'Goblin' to the sweet rhodes and walking bassline of 'On The Edge', which wouldn't sound out of place in the Fair Park catalogue. 'Still Alive' is a light confection of soft pads topped with subtle improvisations, while 'This Side Of The Forest' delivers a more flavoursome Sir Lord Commix-style groove.

Switzerland, the home of flashy one-handed backhands (cc: Roger Federer & Stan Wawrinka), snow capped mountains and more recently a new dance connoisseur in @Ecargva.¬† Wasting little to no time, Ecar has kickstarted his musical journey on his very own label¬†@RoyaltiesRatesRecords (R R R).¬† We're constantly putting pen to paper on unique dance cuts from all across Europe but very rarely from this region and boy do these four tunes spell promise for what's ahead!
¬†
Not much is known of Ecar at this stage but what we do know is that he is an individualistic artist, a sole trader who has always written music by himself. Some may find this a little introverted but for him it has instilled a real sense of 'DIY'. Having the ability to apply and deliver your craft without the assistance or meddling of others can be a golden attribute in music. Ecar tells us that the reason for¬†Royalties¬†Rates existence is simply to become another voice in the beautiful conversation that is club music.
¬†
And what a nostalgic dose of club music we receive on the A1 ""Diana"". Compressed drum breaks kick hard as we're quickly introduced to a twanged out synth scale that sounds as though it's recorded straight from an 80's house party. Unsuspectingly so, the sweet tones of a Diana Ross vocal from 'It's Your Move' enter the fray, alongside a scuttling drum machine, propelling the tune into a swell of positivity.
¬†
The two B sides on the record speak more to the modern late night. In particular, on ""Untitled Waves"", Ecar shows a deep knowledge of the acid genre, taking listeners on a beautifully eerie journey.¬† Tech stabs roll over ethereal synth patterns as the Suisse fellow takes us somewhere else... It's like diving head first into a dank rave scene of cinema, you don't recognize anyone around you yet you're in rapture regardless.
¬†
From what we've heard on the inaugural release from¬†Royalties¬†Rates Records and its head honcho Ecar, there can only be further class audio to come. Only 300 of these gems will pressed, so don't sleep and get your pre-orders in.

In a game flooded with thirsty new talent, quality control and deliberated release frequency is absolutely paramount. Release too often or too monotonously in sound and you might fall off, release too little and people might forget about you. Nachtbraker seems to have found a balance in his production and label management; seeking to keep reinventing himself (and his Quartet Series) to stay fresh, and hoping to make you long for that next release.

Edits, edits, edits. They are everywhere at the moment! There is a label that has been dealing out the good stuff, the pure, 100% authentic raw stuff for a considerable amount of time. This label has been doing their thing since the edit game exploded, the disco DJ‚Äôs favourite, Razor-N-Tape (soundcloud).
If, like us, you are an avid follower of the label then you will know what to expect from their Edit series. Fun, groovy and unquestionably excellent source material, all releases are tasteful homages to the originals, not overdone but with just the right amount of dance floor impact for modern audiences.
Today‚Äôs premiere comes from Reverend P (soundcloud), a Parisian disco don with a history of making killer edits for G.A.M.M. and Basic Fingers. Track B1 is called Way U Get Me.

It‚Äôs not easy to get the balance right when approaching someone as legendary as Barry White, but Reverend P nails it. An altogether DJ friendlier cut, the track builds¬†as the original does but this edit teases and teases without using the overblown sections that the album version has.
There‚Äôs nothing quite like Barry's velvety smooth voice, this edit cuts the right amount and uses the beats and bass with a smattering of the horn section perfectly. All in all, a very well thought out and dancefloor orientated edit. This will be on rotation for a long time!
We look forward to his next edit choice and also the next instalment in Razor-N-Tape‚Äôs wonderful series.

Today we're taking a trip back Down Under as we so often seem to do lately. The Sydney, Australia-based collective, record label and party series¬†@PostPluto are about to celebrate their fourth release and we've got the lowdown. The imprint curates small run vinyl releases with a focus on music that is ""soulful, deep and more human than machine"". Tracks laced with classic hip-hop samples and chunky, hazy beats have been the norm to date. Another important fact to note is that their catalogue thus far, including their upcoming release, is 100% locally sourced talent.

@djriggles is yet another fresh talent up-and-coming from the Harbour City who made his debut early this year with a single on a V.A. for fellow Aussie label¬†Ken Oath Records. ""No Doors"" EP marks his first solo multiple-track venture and it also includes a remix from Sonderr. Our premiere today and what we believe to be the standout of the release is the A1 'Doomsdsay'. There is a marked difference between this cut and the rest of the EP, although the whole record falls wholly within the aforementioned range of Post Pluto's sound. While 'Doomsday', despite the title,¬†sparkles and shines in a carefree manner, the rest of the EP sits on the cloudier side with crunchy drums and heady grooves, yet their titles, 'Shine' and¬†'Perfect Day', also seem to convey the opposite. Sampling MF Doom's classic cut of the same name (which in turn sampled Sade's 'Kiss of Life'),¬†Doomsday takes a piece of the original and ups the pitch and tempo. The light percussion sets a perfect groove around the wistful chords while a harp gracefully twirls its way around the arrangement, giving it that breezy flair perfect for the current summer season in the Northern Hemisphere.",10.0,False,0.0,Post Pluto,425.0,https://soundcloud.com/boltingbits/riggles-doomsday,7761.0,72

Batter up

She makes your swagger

Then disappear

Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer
Well my body gonna need a moment

Second Verse
Many men
Think they better than
Miss in your face
Doubt your fire Could
last a match

Anytime
Anywhere

She'll take you on
Take a second
take apart your flair

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

this tape is the culmination of the emotions i've felt and the music i've made over the summer of 2017. 

as it came together, the theme formed into a combination of different summer feelings and vibes, and i tried translating that into the music.

get outside, go fishing, surround yourself with good people, and play this.

this tape is dedicated to all my friends, love you guys.

Shrimpnose ~ Dawn

If we take a Day to mean 'the pendulum,' swinging forth with dawn, back with dusk, only to begin anew with another fresh dawn just ahead, we've likewise stumbled upon a fair metaphor for a Life. 

Through the brevity of Minneapolis producer Shrimpnose's 11-minute Dawn, we get just a lick of this cycle. 

Dedicated to the memory of friend Donnie Lind, Shrimpnose seems, through a sturdy atmosphere of chunky kicks and grain-laced samples, to trace ever so economically the brief in-and-out of a human life. 

Beginning with the eeriness of dawn in all it's limitlessness, proceeding through to an accomplished and sleep-ready dusk, Shrimpnose ultimately takes us to 'back then,' a place not so nostalgic as it is truly alive; a place where donnie must surely be smiling at his own apprehension of an oft-forgotten truth: that dawn will come again, just as ripe with unimpeded opportunity now as it was then.

Chillhop is back in 2018 with a fresh look and sound for the Essentials series.
We're excited to keep developing and exploring the sound spectrum this year and for this first Essentials release celebrating the start of Spring we gathered 22 artists that have been killing it lately to compose an exclusive track that fits the Spring mood.

These 22 tracks can be listened to via your favorite digital music platform and can also be purchased as a limited edition double 12"" vinyl.
This year's artwork for the Essentials compilations is done by Brazilian illustrator Mauro Martins and perfectly compliments the music on the record. The vinyl comes as a gatefold so you can enjoy the artwork in its full glory.

in.the.forest.we.are.wizards is an ep about childhood nostalgia. about places that no longer exist, people who are no longer with us, endless summer days filled with mystery and wonder.. personally, playing the piano brings back so many memories, and that is one of the reasons why I chose this ep to be so piano driven..

hopefully you can enjoy and relax to this one... if you want to talk about anything, just drop me a msg..

Oooh, MAX baby

(Verse) Lil Mosey
I can‚Äôt explain the feeling I get when I call you mine 
And you know I know you well, what‚Äôs on your mind 
It ain‚Äôt the same without you, real love is hard to find 
And I can‚Äôt stop looking in those blue eyes
Oh my, shawty so fly
Need you all night, need you for life
She look like wow, in love with your smile 
And every time I get to

(Chorus) MAX
Kiss you each morning
With strawberry skies
I get so lost in
Your blueberry eyes
I‚Äôm running through my dreams 
To see you in the light
Cause I get so lost in 
Your blueberry eyes

i dont got nothin but time
i feel it burning inside
the ghosts of my past they berate me
the feeling just cannot escape me
hate me but you are forgiven
this is the point that youre missin
blind faith in apparitions
no way to lose inhabitions

shadows in the dark
ripping out my beating heart
wiping blood off of my face
there isnt much you could take from me
crying on the phone
feeling numb down to the bone
watch the world turn into ashes
as i suffer alone again

wasting the day
and im wasting your space
you told me to get the fuck out your face
sometimes i wish i could just fade away
the same way the ink on my skin turns to grey

scars on my body remind me of pain
reminding me that nothing will be the same
reminding me that nothing gold ever stays
and itll always be this way

violence in the purest form
we both know when it rains it pours

shadows in the dark
ripping out my beating heart
wiping blood off of my face
there isnt much you could take from me
crying on the phone
feeling numb down to the bone
watch the world turn into ashes
as i suffer alone again

lyrics:
i‚Äôm happy for you
i‚Äôm smiling for you
i‚Äôd do anything 
for you for you

it‚Äôs always for you
and never or me
i need it to stop 
so let me tell you please

i‚Äôm always sad
and i‚Äôm always lonely 
but i can‚Äôt tell you 
that i‚Äôm breaking slowly

closed doors
locked in, no keys
keeping my feelings hidden 
there is no ease

i need it to stop
and i want to be able
to open up but, 
my feelings are fatal
(my feelings are fatal)

how many times
must i keep it inside
i need to let go 
and i swear that i‚Äôve tried

but opening up 
means trusting others
and that‚Äôs just too much, 
i don‚Äôt want to bother

so i‚Äôll keep it inside 
and bury it deep
i know it‚Äôs not healthy 
but you won‚Äôt hear a peep

though i‚Äôm always sad
and i‚Äôm always lonely
i could never tell you
that i‚Äôm breaking slowly

closed doors
locked in, no keys
keeping my feelings hidden 
there is no ease

i need it to stop
and i want to be able
to open up but,

Lyrics:
It's been about thirty two minutes or so/
and I'm clutching foolish optimism like she'll slip through the door/
and sit down with a story, telling of traffic -
""Would you care for a refill?""/
yeah, thank you, sorry I tend to overshare with people/
it's just I've had quite the crush on her for - ""I'll be right back with your drink""/
oh well, it's only been sixty-one minutes I think/
clink ice cubes with a straw, the table's candles forming puddles/
rest my fist below my jaw, her car could be the source of trouble/
but she hasn't read the multitude of texts I sent, and I won't reprehend/
like it could be an emergency, or she went to bed, maybe she just -/
""Sorry to interrupt, but are you ready to order?
we're closing soon, I recommend the lobster on arugula, the dish is new and-""/
No, I'll get the fettuccine, please, with chicken/
text her one last time, it's urgent, damn, she knows the evening's ticking/ 
like I'm a decent guy, well, at least from what I've heard/
I don't think I'll find the courage to stand up and say goodbye/

and I'm still waiting, wait here oh so patient/
wait here all long night, resolve never waning/
and still I'm waiting, wait here oh so patient/
wait here all long night, I'm waiting and waiting/

I'm waiting for her to reply to my text/
I know it says ""seen"" but maybe she didn't see it just yet/
""I guess, but you've been here for three days, that doesn't seem strange to you?""  
So what? She's late, and this table's purely made for two/
my plate of food, has grown a bit cold in the past month/ 
but it's not too far fetched for someone to run late and catch up/
any second now, she'll- 
""Do you want this to go, or should I just throw it out, it's been a year-""/
No thanks, no point in acting like it's over now/
I know my beard's an overgrowth and I'm becoming one with this chair/
but a decade's nothing, I won't be the one who's under-prepared/
for the future, cause she'll arrive and we'll survive the ruins/
until time folds in upon itself, so what's your two cents?/
...hm, I guess he left or he closing up the business/
I can hear metallic thumping and explosions in the distance/
a stray dog is chewing on a human bone right by the entrance/
there's barbaric men outside and all they're toting make-shift weapons/
I just think it's odd she's hasn't tried to phone or send a message/
but I'll wait right here 'til time as we know it is non-existent/
I'll just wait here and drink until the last one's dry/
I mean c'mon really, I'm a stand up guy/",146.0,False,0.0,Hip-hop & Rap,6230.0,https://soundcloud.com/headhaunter/stand-up-guy-feat-ibrahim,413719.0,367

Atwood:
Swear to god that my squad filled with geniuses
They think I'm meaningless, i told em genius it
Off top swear that God what my genus is
Don't believe me, you gon start, this the genesis
Atwood spit fire, get charred leaves
Burn money, weed, green glisten when he sparks heat
Ignition from the car keys
Listen to the heart beats
Yall think yall compete with him?
Pssh. Hardly
Ay
I'm from the Far East
Nah
I'm from the Mid West
Nah
I'm from Down South 
Yah
We always get -head
Uh
The type of guy, wanna speak his mind and then pleads the fifth 
Go to Britain fried, hella high, just to eat the chips
Huh, can you believe this shit
Pool's shtick, spin heads that's that english, kid
Fans throw hands up like bulimics did
And I'm just sitting here reading lyrics on genius, shit..

Chris Wright:
Cadillac memories, you always bring the top down
Matter fact, ‚Äòmember me? fuck it we can‚Äôt stop now
Butterscotch and Hennessy, she double faded, crossed out
I‚Äôm busy burning MP3‚Äôs to cd‚Äôs that get tossed out
And that‚Äôs the feeling every morning I wake up
Doc prescribed me medicine, fellatio, and k cups
Spending all my money keeping track of all my pay stubs
Ten toes down but you know I keep my face up
Writing poems in a winter frozen empty car
Listening to wind and how the vocals glitch on npr
If I can find the balance ‚Äòtween all this I know it‚Äôd get me far
From rock bottom promises to court rooms boy that sentence hard
The young underdog, low key running businesses
These fake haters, stay shading trynna be my nemesis

SPOTIFY:
https://open.spotify.com/album/0YsuObPPJFmMScTr6UH6F0

I named the genre Dream-Hop because I wanted to give it the dreamy feel of lo-fi with the hard drum patterns of hip-hop. Many things inspired the project: Anime (Sailor Moon, SAO), Japanese culture, Spirited Away, Nujabes, Maruchan ramen, sushi, Edinburgh, my muse Annasophia Robb, lofi producers (bsd.u, Entact, O K H O), vinyl records, and much more. I wanted to make a standalone dream-hop album that people can just relax or do homework to. The cover art is inspired by a cassette tape, and it features Venus from the Japanese anime Sailor Moon which I used to love as a kid.

Finally, I'd like to thank my fellow ODT collective mates Melrose and RSTY, as well as Bernard Willis and Entact for providing dope verses and remixes. Thanks to the whole ONEDAYTHOUGH family, to my family for always supporting me, and thank you to the fans for giving me a reason to do all this.

@nosentences

got my eyes on the computer screen, tryna work my digits in
fidget with the lettering but never with the sentences
pause check the clock, and it appears it's six a.m. again
another night wasted or another day finished
and my mind is steady running in place
i don't wanna fall asleep, 'cause i've got so much to say
but i don't wanna stay awake and keep exhaustion at bay
because i presently am dead inside the bed where i lay
i might as well work now, maybe it could suffice
as more a method of confusion than a dip into life
it's like my body parts are planning out an intricate heist
but my mind is logged in on a different device
and my session expired, i'm exceptionally tired
every step is like fire straight from my head to my toes
see, i'm an excellent liar when i've slept the required
8 or 7 hours prior, but at present i'ma go the fuck to sleep and--

*bwoooooooooomp*

okay rise and shine, hello to the ladybugs
insert several other stupid phrases about waking up
rub the sleep out of my eyes and view the clock that hangs above
and hit the snooze a couple times to keep my hours 8 or plus
check my phone once, twice, three times, four
just so i can see the second i'm messaged by mon amour
for a date or a small excursion straight to a donut store
where i'm holding an open door to convey that i'm spoken for
and it's great, it's a total score, it's a wonderful set of things
that exist in my present bubble of love where the petals sing
as they're blooming on every flower, moving to better springs
engulfed in a heavy shower of rain that the weather brings
and... even though my days might be presented slow
they pass before my eyes at higher rates than even jets can go
and the cycle will repeat itself like history and reddit posts
so what's the point in fighting it? i'm staying up and letting go",254.0,False,135.0,Hip-hop & Rap,16364.0,https://soundcloud.com/atlas/alarm,1202518.0,1103

happy valentine's day :)

art by bennie (http://www.instagram.com/cozylile)

this is a thank you for everything
a semi-colon hovering where something once was menacing
a ""soon-to-be continued"" that exists after the ending screen
the only song i know that i would ever even wish to sing
when the heat is blistering, you're the ice that's glistening
inside my cup of tea, which is also you... interesting
throughout all the seasons, in this transition of winter-spring
you've been here beside me with the sweet nothings you're whispering
you're a lovable, angelic piece of perfect
and anything i do for you is worth it
times a million and a half, we can sit and be resilient and laugh
in between the subtle compliments and billlions of half-
kiss/half-hug/half-cuddle moments we share
i know it's unfair that we could only spend a few days here
but i'm yours, and i think that it's clear
so forget about goodbye, this is ""see you soon, my dear""

'cause i love you and i'd like to spend forever
in the sublte warmth inside your arms, like fireplaces' embers
i will try my best to keep you by my side until the weather
turns apocalyptic, and we end up drifting to the nether
but we'd still be wearing sweaters when we got there
'cause we're both too caught up in cuteness to care 'bout hot air
and even if it burnt me alive, i'd have my crosshairs
set up on your heart, making art, 'cause why stop there?
i'll keep on creating for you until my final days
dancing in the living room and smooching while the vinyl plays
i've been losing track of the romantic shit i'm tryna say
but basically i love you and that's kinda gay...
i'ma stay by your side when i can
keep your grip on my hand
'cause we can both hear the compliments coming in from these pals of mine
i've been wondering if you would be my valentine",534.0,False,80.0,Hip-hop & Rap,28727.0,https://soundcloud.com/atlas/valentine,2106489.0,1834

With previous appearances on Transatlantyk, the auspicious newcomer slots neatly into the STEP catalogue in presenting his ‚ÄòUnderworld‚Äô EP: a package of softly glowing lo-fi that fans of Baltra‚Äôs recent ‚ÄòSophia‚Äô EP on STEP will relish. ‚ÄòFrequenza‚Äô kicks things off a soft, sizzling pad sent ducking under a rock-hard kick drum. Icy strings and a trippy spoken are introduced before ‚ÄòKora Buta‚Äô follows up with some warm, swooning sample work. ‚ÄòSleeper‚Äô is next up as distant, meandering thumb pianos and rainy textures colour the tracks fuzzy drums while a glassy, Legowelt-esque pad glides overhead.

i am an ocean
your presence
is as warm as the sun
but it seems like
i only get to be with
a reflection
nobody wants to 
swim in the wind 
(on a cloudy day)
and every message i traced
into the sand 
got washed away 
sometimes 
my cries
sound like
beautiful echoes 
the ocean 
is violent
i'm frightened
on so many levels 
i am an endless abyss
i wish that you wanted to swim 
but i know
that your bones
would crack underneath the pressure
yet you still say 
that you wanna know me
on a deeper level
you can't swim 
your love is land 
you're only searching for that buried treasure
as if my secrets
locked inside
could ever bring you any sort of pleasure
i guess i forget
you fell in love
with the mountains
i guess i forget
you fell in love
with the mountains

[i've never been
seasick before
i swam to far and i can't
see the shore ]

laying down
underneath a willow tree 
at that place 
we used to laugh so happily
i can hear the water 
moving forward
lapping at my feet
lapping at my feet

take your shoes off
dip your feet in 
let yourself adore 
this feeling 

[ would you like?
would you like?
would you like to kiss me? ] 

eyes are red
this isn't fair
i pull my hair
and rest my head 
in between my knees
i can barely breathe

-lyrics-

hook:
i lost you at the start
now i can't finish off
i don't know if i can get right back to it
see you all up in my head
and i feel you in my heart
that's a beat but i don‚Äôt know if i can rap to it
you left me in the dark
now I‚Äôm tryna find the light inside
but i can't do the math to it

i lost you at the start 
now i can‚Äôt finish off
i don‚Äôt know if i can do this anymore

said you felt you had to leave
so i had to let you go
now i‚Äôm watching you go walk up out the front door
 
i don‚Äôt know where the fuck you going
i just know it's better not knowing
pull up off your block, yea i ride it like its stolen
whipping through the stop signs i just had to roll em

said its too soon
try to see the good but its coming every blue moon
watch my every move like you posted out on youtube
start to see the light think it feels like a good mood
know I‚Äôm bout to conclude
i can‚Äôt do it anymore
fell way below that floor
now i go and pour a four 
every time i open up that door
think we had it had the start 
apart i thought i lost my heart 
now I‚Äôm bringing up my guard
man it‚Äôs hard dog

this album will eventually see a physical release in 2017. lofihiphop.bandcamp.com will be offering more physical releases from various lofi artists in the near future. 

It's been a great year for lofi.hiphop and I really can't believe how far we've come already. Looking forward to an even bigger year in 2017.

lyrics:
Those green eyes I used to think were brown
I didn‚Äôt look at them long enough when you still were around
And I know I‚Äôm nothing special but can I please mean something to you
And I think you‚Äôre pretty different and I wonder if you think of me too

How I wish I could be the blue eyes you dream about at night
How I wish I could be that girl, she‚Äôs such a sight to see
I can‚Äôt ever be the one that fills your cup
And I can‚Äôt ever measure up
So i‚Äôll leave you to

These brown eyes you never took the time to admire
In the mirror they stare back at me and I‚Äôm tired
I‚Äôm tired of feeling this much animosity towards me
Cuz I long to be the girl with the blue eyes you dream about at night
And I know I can‚Äôt compare so I‚Äôll just give up this fight
I can‚Äôt ever be the one that fills your cup
And I can‚Äôt ever measure up
So i‚Äôll leave you two 
I'll leave you too

Those green eyes saw me through and through

shifting sands and shrinking plans
in these injured hands; kick the crabs in the bucket. 
happy enough in the shack, slacking and slumped in his habits
gagging to covet trapped in a parish of puppets...
fuck it. 
this ain't nothing but a test
lover running for the best, covers flooding on the chest. 
sullen and depressed 
words woven just to wipe away the woe... to find the face.
he cried for days still, 

silent sneers chime in titans ears 
and kids still grapple with the shadows in their bunk beds.
the sands flow like rivers until the sun sets. 
the sands flow like rivers until the sun rests. 
'nough stress as the clock face screams
so we puff cest for the lost day dreams, like...

with this song he put the ruby to the lip. 
tongue tied lucy on the tip. 
dumb fights, mum cried, lucy in the whip. 
apple of the eye and now he chewing on the pip. 

every day same old shit different day now.
all the grey clouds stay; shamed as rain pounds. 
chained down by fate paved since the stained gown.

""a deep. wistful, nostalgic sense of longing for home; a yearning grief for people and things long gone""

Well there we go, another EP :)! This one is a bit different than the last one, its not lofi, its not rly hiphopbeatthingwhateveryouwannacallit, its more subtle, more ambient and melancholic I guess. It's more of a personal album, as it does showcase some different emotional stages that I have gone through in the last couple of months, it has been a rollercoaster and it still kind of is, but oh well.
In any case, hope you enjoy these tracks. And I hope they appeal to a larger audience, and I especially hope that some people can relate to these tracks, and maybe even find some sort of comfort in at least one of them. PEACEEEEEEE

[Verse 1]
I gotta go now,
I can‚Äôt stay here,
I'm too stressed out,
Counting my grey hairs,
Maybe I'm road kill,
They want me to lay there,
Got two jobs cuz they don't even pay here
I was just tryna make the flow pop
Somewhere tryna fuck the new girl co-op‚Äôs
Had to learn learn the game
I ain't making more stops
Wouldn't hand me the key so I'm breaking more locks
No I'm not chillen
Obsessed with my plan like a villain
Play Piccolos on you Crillens
Did it all for a feelin
Music is my penicillin
The sacrifice I was willin
Interning all week
You swear I do this for me
I swear I do this for free
You swear I do this for me
Boss made me get him coffee
5 sugars extra sweet 
Then passive aggressive emails 
Cuz I forgot the receipts
Cuz I forgot the receipts nigga?

Beginning in the south, the Bruce Trail hugs the ancient shoreline of Lake Iroquoia as it follows the edge of the Niagara Escarpment. The Path, over its lengthy journey, winds its way through a landscape of natural beauty as it moves up to central Ontario. 
As the Trail leads further into the depths of the woodland and Ravine, sunlight falls through layers of evergreen branches stamping intricate patterns on the forest floor. Continuing north, the Trail passes an array of plants and wildlife native to the historic forest. Vivid colours saturate the forest canopy, complimented by the sounds of the cascading waterfall echoing through the Ravine. In the distance a carpet of gently waving fern cover the rolling hills dotted with slow-growing centuries-old coniferous trees that reach towards the sun.
At the home stretch of the escarpment you will be offered stunning views of the Peninsula, with the calm blue water of the western end of Lake Ontario reaching out to the lush greens of the temperate rainforest. This is the journey of the Bruce Trail.

260294841,279381959,Moments,32878339,Waking Dreams,"   I wrote this song while I was in Korea, where I was for the past 3 weeks. It was quite an experience being there... I got to know some people, who I never would have imagined meeting, if I didn't go on this trip. And they became important people to me, almost like family. I definitely enjoyed every moment I spent in that place, don't think I'll ever forget it...

So I guess this is a song dedicated to those people. ^~^

Maybe one day I can meet some of you as well! :D

I named the genre Dream-Hop because I wanted to give it the dreamy feel of lo-fi with the hard drum patterns of hip-hop. Many things inspired the project: Anime (Sailor Moon, SAO), Japanese culture, Spirited Away, Nujabes, Maruchan ramen, sushi, Edinburgh, my muse Annasophia Robb, lofi producers (bsd.u, Entact, O K H O), vinyl records, and much more. I wanted to make a standalone dream-hop album that people can just relax or do homework to. The cover art is inspired by a cassette tape, and it features Venus from the Japanese anime Sailor Moon which I used to love as a kid.

Finally, I'd like to thank my fellow ODT collective mates Melrose and RSTY, as well as Bernard Willis and Entact for providing dope verses and remixes. Thanks to the whole ONEDAYTHOUGH family, to my family for always supporting me, and thank you to the fans for giving me a reason to do all this.

Intergalactic soundshifter Bop is back with yet another mind-bending release on Hospital Records. Made up of four fresh dance music delights each exploring different pockets of the sonic spectrum, the Saint Petersburg-based musical wizard explores the sounds of UK garage, techno, jungle, electronica and ambient on his latest ‚ÄòPlexus‚Äô EP.

‚Äò2gether‚Äô opens the release with a futuristic garage number which is set to light up dancefloors throughout the galaxy. Off-beat dubbed out synths, skittery percussions and a classic UK garage bassline with a modern twist are channelled into an all-round electronic weapon, crafted together intricately by Bop.

Entering into the realm of hypnotic techno, ‚ÄòReform‚Äô sees a raw amalgamation of vibrations that will elevate the mind into a higher state of consciousness. Thumping kick drums and dreamlike synthesis carry the weight of the tune as Bop further demonstrates how his flexible approach to production continues to go unmatched in the world of dance music.

Stepping up the tempo on the aptly titled ‚ÄòSurfing The Anxiety Waves‚Äô, Bop puts his minimal spin on a new-wave jungle slammer. Expect a resonant bassline which falls downwards into the pits of your stomach, accompanied by hard-hitting breakbeats which fizzle out into nothingness before coming back around to strike again. This one is not for the faint hearted.

‚ÄòGuilt Of Being A Human‚Äô rounds off the EP with playful melodies and elements of Bop‚Äôs classic microfunk sound, reminiscent of his earlier works such as ‚ÄòA Song About My Dog‚Äô. This electronic delicacy is filled with a vast sense of spaciousness, scattered with a seemingly never-ending amount of musical intricacies.

Not one for sticking to one style, Bop‚Äôs versatile sound has seen him rack up support from an array of tastemakers. His most recent ‚ÄòPerehod‚Äô EP received the seal of approval from the likes of Ejeca, London Elektricity, Laurent Garnier and Oneman. Also no stranger to topping charts outside of the drum & bass world, his ‚ÄòHaze‚Äô track with Subwave reached number 1 on the Beatport Garage chart. With support over the years from the likes of DJ Mag and Resident Advisor, as well as radio support on BBC Radio 1, Rinse FM and Reprezent, not to mention the running of his very own esteemed Microfunk imprint, the sounds of Bop continue to ripple into 2021 and beyond.

Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,
And thats whats left

Who's the number 2 killer
Shes the number 2 killer
Well my body gonna need a moment

Second Verse
Many men
Think they better than
Miss in your face
Doubt your fire Could
last a match

Anytime
Anywhere

She'll take you on
Take a second
take apart your flair

Have you heard the tale
Of how you lost your mind
Story goes she came, you saw,

About College Music:
At College Music, we find and showcase the latest work from up and coming artists. Whether you're about to go out, having a party or just relaxing; we aim to represent something exciting, attractive and inviting. The name originated because a small group of friends while at college struggled to find music which had originality and didn't conform to the generic ""pop"" which was consistently released to the public. College Music is about new music from unheard artists and providing a platform for them to be heard by listeners like us. We firmly believe that a brand‚Äôs name, ethos, and content should all align together.

""White wall white wall when do you predict my fall
Ive failed every little thing that ive sworn
Ive lost a lot, the gains seem so little
Bonds are unbreakable yet mine seem so brittle
In the middle, which path leads back home
Why, why do they laugh so, cause of the gastro
If i made mad dough and reach for the astros
Could they still belittle, with they gats froze
Merely a scenario, i still lack those
Wanting the whole package, yet you still lactose
Youre here to keep me safe, but are you to keep me sane
Two sides of a coin with results you cant complain
Will you still ignore me, and paint me with your plain
Or will you adore me, and keep me from the pain
I present my case to these four horsemen
Why do i hide my face, its to at least keep a portion
A precaution

Thats the way the paint dries
Symbolizing tears that pour down from my eyes
But why cry, i hide behind like a shy-guy
Looking to be noticed but never in the primetime
Silent is my audience, I ask if you exist
Tomatoes born from nothing til i make an exit
White wall White wall why so petty
You contain so much yet im still so empty

White wall white wall why no answer
I confide to you my emotional financer
Emotions are black, is that maybe the reason
Define as treason for betraying my favourite season
Coat the world in pure, how can i endure
When i dont belong in a world so sure
Confidence is key, yet i lack the lock
Maybe take the lead, and give the door a knock
No jiggle on the handle life in a standstill
Cuffed to an anvil and told to stand still
You have to wait your turn to join the landfill
Avoid the trample, ease with an advil
Vision blurred already, out fades the medley 
Who knew that silence could feel this heavy
White wall white wall i bid farewell
My silent adviser, i descend the stairwell""

""White wall white wall when do you predict my fall
Ive failed every little thing that ive sworn
Ive lost a lot, the gains seem so little
Bonds are unbreakable yet mine seem so brittle
In the middle, which path leads back home
Why, why do they laugh so, cause of the gastro
If i made mad dough and reach for the astros
Could they still belittle, with they gats froze
Merely a scenario, i still lack those
Wanting the whole package, yet you still lactose
Youre here to keep me safe, but are you to keep me sane
Two sides of a coin with results you cant complain
Will you still ignore me, and paint me with your plain
Or will you adore me, and keep me from the pain
I present my case to these four horsemen
Why do i hide my face, its to at least keep a portion
A precaution

Thats the way the paint dries
Symbolizing tears that pour down from my eyes
But why cry, i hide behind like a shy-guy
Looking to be noticed but never in the primetime
Silent is my audience, I ask if you exist
Tomatoes born from nothing til i make an exit
White wall White wall why so petty
You contain so much yet im still so empty

White wall white wall why no answer
I confide to you my emotional financer
Emotions are black, is that maybe the reason
Define as treason for betraying my favourite season
Coat the world in pure, how can i endure
When i dont belong in a world so sure
Confidence is key, yet i lack the lock
Maybe take the lead, and give the door a knock
No jiggle on the handle life in a standstill
Cuffed to an anvil and told to stand still
You have to wait your turn to join the landfill
Avoid the trample, ease with an advil
Vision blurred already, out fades the medley 
Who knew that silence could feel this heavy

I like to think I‚Äôm well-equipped as any other average guy 
but I just can‚Äôt discover love and I don‚Äôt even set my standards high
on top of that, I‚Äôm camera shy, maybe I should opt-out of the dating pool
and be an undercover tinder samurai

cause I would rather type online than whisper in a dingy bar
and swiping left and right could be my new bushido ninja star
and I‚Äôm well-versed in virtual lovemaking ninjutsu 
on every profile pic I post, I‚Äôm posing with my shitzu
or flexing with my shirt off cause I heard that gets you hits too

Especially OkCupid, I‚Äôm like Eros or the cherubs be,
I pierce hearts of women with my cursor and my arrow keys
and disregard my Roman roots and choose a font that‚Äôs serif-free,

trust me,

 I‚Äôm a tinder bio brainiac
the way I kindle fire with matches, I‚Äôm a pyromaniac
on christian mingle, I‚Äôm a casanova,
if ya‚Äôll don‚Äôt think so, y‚Äôall can ask Jehovah
check your inbox, he might send an answer over

I wish I had the muscles of a granite sculpture
I would log on ashleymadison and bang adulterers
I‚Äôm so lonely, I‚Äôve considered farmers-only
just for someone‚Äôs arms to hold me
also, I‚Äôm really big on agriculture

but if I had that body of a grecian god
I would trawl on pof.com and use it as a fishing rod
and hope I don‚Äôt get catfish,
the fact is if I did, I‚Äôd probably play along cause god knows I could use the practice,

and if I‚Äôm aching for my roots, I‚Äôd visit shaadi.com
message islamic wahhabi hijabi hotties ‚Äúsalaam‚Äù
and sunni, shia, those are both denominations I respect
cause I just care for our connection, 

I don‚Äôt care about the sects

sometimes I uninstall my apps in reckless insurrectious rage
and then regret it while I check the craiglist missed connections page
and then I think that I should get out more and disregard my mobile cell
and get to know the local teller at my barnes and noble well
and check out what she‚Äôs reading while she‚Äôs charging up my total sale
and ask her if she likes the novel,
and once she answers, ask her if wants to grab some coffee or some ice cream waffles,
and she‚Äôd probably say that‚Äôs awesome, 

 I‚Äôd ask her when she‚Äôs off of work,

 she might answer ‚Äúmidnight‚Äù

 I‚Äôd tell her that sounds awful, 

what a bummer, and from somewhere
I might muster up the nerve to get her number,

 and I would ask her what her digits are
and if I play it right then I can disregard my ninja stars, 
say sayonara to katanas and my other weapons too

Hailing from the hazy streets of NYC, Baltra's trademark sounds have been pleasing the ears of ravers and recliners alike and appeared on just about every dance music list worth a dime at the conclusion of 2016. With recent releases on labels such as Craigie Knowes and Hokkaido Dance Club, Tape Throb are honoured to bring Short Term Goals to vinyl and to contribute to the rise and rise of this talented producer. Think throbbing drums and universal chords with that trademark Baltra warmth that keeps you coming back for more. Ethereal vocals dance on punchy base and silky refrains give you just enough time to catch your breath. All the radiating warmth of house, with all the reminders that you are experiencing something seminal, these are beats on the cusp.",4.0,False,0.0,Deep House,160.0,https://soundcloud.com/tape-throb-records/b1-feds-watching,7575.0,22

In June we released a pressing of 400, which sold out in less than 12 hours. Due to overwhelming demand, we have reissued it as a run of 800. And its available right now!

Thank you to S U R F I N G for creating a masterpiece, and thank you to the supporters who have allowed me to turn my vinyl-wish-list into reality. I look forward to helping create more beautiful records though this outlet in the future. It is an honor to have ""Deep Fantasy"" be the first 100% Electronica album not created in-house.

""Deep Fantasy"" is available on limited vinyl now at www.100percentelectronica.com

Lyrics:

If I look at you
Will you look back at me the same?
(Aah)
And deep down I'm scared
That I'm not prepared to love.
(Aah)
When I see your smile,
I stop for a while and gaze.
(Aah)
And I wonder when
All of this will end
Mmmm...
(Aah)

p.s. Lyrics! (requested by @vanillacaterpillar ) ~~~

Stay with me, my morning dew
Won't you be my love?
I need all you're givin me
It's you, oh you I'm dreamin of

All day long I'm day dreamin
Lookin out the window at the sun
In my tiny mind, I'm hiding out
Thinkin bout my lovely little one

In the time I spend with my head up in space, man
I am thinkin of your face
And when the morning sunlight brightens up my basement
I can feel your warm embrace

Since the day my love was born,
He was bound to come my way
Now he's here and here to stay,
Right until my dying day

In the time I spend with my head up in space, man
I am thinkin of your face
And when the morning sunlight brightens up my basement
I can feel your warm embrace,
Lover.

hopefully you can enjoy and relax to this one... if you want to talk about anything, just drop me a msg..

i am eternally grateful to you grandma for all those days we got to hang out at your place when we were kids. <3

'College Music Presents: Back on Track' is a twenty nine track compilation featuring original music from artists and producers the world over. 'Back on Track' aims to act as a beacon of hope after a tricky few years across the world. College Music Records have carefully selected a wide range of artists to feature on the project, spanning from UK, America, Europe and beyond. The end result is a wide array of uplifting vibes, from instrumental beats and jazzy joints to euphoric vocal breakbeats and lo-fi house, featuring the likes of Tennyson, Cookin Soul, Athletic Progression, L'ind√©cis, edbl and a lot more.

Listen to the compilation on all platforms:
‚Üí cmrecords.co.uk/back-on-track

The artwork itself, done by the incredible Doug John Miller (http://instagram.com/dougjohnmiller) reflects the journey from the darker, lockdown days to present day and beyond, where things are looking far brighter. We aimed to represent this positive shift in the music selected within the project, hoping to offer a glimmer of light to people in their dark days.

The project title ' Back on Track' reflects how things have come off the rails in the past few years, but that better times are on the way, and as a collective, we are gradually getting 'Back on Track'.

'College Music Presents: Back on Track' is a twenty nine track compilation featuring original music from artists and producers the world over. 'Back on Track' aims to act as a beacon of hope after a tricky few years across the world. College Music Records have carefully selected a wide range of artists to feature on the project, spanning from UK, America, Europe and beyond. The end result is a wide array of uplifting vibes, from instrumental beats and jazzy joints to euphoric vocal breakbeats and lo-fi house, featuring the likes of Tennyson, Cookin Soul, Athletic Progression, L'ind√©cis, edbl and a lot more.

Listen to the compilation on all platforms:
‚Üí cmrecords.co.uk/back-on-track

The artwork itself, done by the incredible Doug John Miller (http://instagram.com/dougjohnmiller) reflects the journey from the darker, lockdown days to present day and beyond, where things are looking far brighter. We aimed to represent this positive shift in the music selected within the project, hoping to offer a glimmer of light to people in their dark days.

The project title ' Back on Track' reflects how things have come off the rails in the past few years, but that better times are on the way, and as a collective, we are gradually getting 'Back on Track'.

After the well received first release, Axe Traxx returns with another collection of rough, raw, filtered house killer tracks. The first EP from Sonderr and remixed by Mall Grab (both Australian) was supported by many in the scene and this split EP showcases two different approaches to analogue productions. The raw in your face filtered House of Parisian talent Trudge and the always splendidly crafted grooves of Sagat and DJ octopus, aka Die Roh. Trudge's 'Give' sounds like a mix between Mall Grab and Ross From Friends, between Churches and Lobster Theremin: a distorted and in part broken 909 beat guides the cut, whilst a slow melodic loved up vocal creates the perfect summery vibe.

LYRICS:
How‚Äôd we turn back into strangers
Scared I don‚Äôt know who you are
We used to talk about love and the universe
Only the weather come up anymore
Think I‚Äôm afraid you okay
Think my regrets didn‚Äôt fade with the pain
I should have stayed
I should have stayed
I should have stayed

I should have treated you better
But instead I ran away
Thought I believed in forever
But whether its worth it depends on the day
Can‚Äôt look you straight in your face
Can‚Äôt pretend I‚Äôm moving on
I can‚Äôt believe that you gone
I can‚Äôt believe that you gone

Tryna be friends feel like murder to me
Liked it better when we didn‚Äôt talk
Reminiscing takes you further from me
Thinking bout the people that we really not
‚Ä®Our house by the waterfall
The dream that we built and we shared
And we killed and repaired in the moments we lost it all
A fantasy faded we called it off

Just a reminder of better days
And how much I hate being second place
And that its fine if I forget your face
And just how we better off anyways
And all of the innocence that we just stole from each other
Cause we was still kids at heart
The only thing keeping me company since you don‚Äôt love me‚Äôs‚Ä®A dream that just lingers on

Our house by the waterfall
The dream we rebuilt and we shared
And we killed and repaired again right when we lost it all
‚Ä®I haven‚Äôt forgot at all",16.0,True,75.0,pastel,622.0,https://soundcloud.com/dahm-the-rapper/our-house-by-the-waterfall-prod-rook1e,42305.0,78

Produced on an array of hardware in Steve‚Äôs bedroom in Rome, this is a refreshingly honest EP and takes the label into somewhat nostalgic territory. 

90‚Äôs ballads meet sampled italo percussion, skittish pitched up vocals pierce dangerous basslines and lung busting breakdowns give way to searching lasers in smoke filled rooms. English born Italian Steve Langrish accomplishes all this with a level of effortlessness that belies his astonishingly young years. 

An impressive debut for sure. Watch this space ‚Äì Slim‚Äôs comin!",69.0,False,0.0,Lust,1389.0,https://soundcloud.com/x-kalay/xk005-clips,42623.0,109

Merry Christmas! today we have a special song just for you <3 this one is called ""Liqour"", a collaboration between MaXD and JKuch, two very talented artists.
this track is magical, full of dreamy synths and addicting melodies. it starts out nice and mellow, and progressively builds more into a heavier electro vibe, while still maintaining that chill old-VHS-tape sound. from start to finish, the whole song is truly a captivating experience.

be sure to keep an eye on our soundcloud, we'll be releasing 3 songs a week (Mon, Wed and Fri) for this album and there is 20 songs total.

999251734,322194117,Elyon - Andante [Lo-fi],6415300,Elyon,"A friend and I were talking about ""Lo-fi"" hiphop genre and about how it's becoming ""popular"" again. I personally enjoy listening to this genre but never tried creating something in it. ""Lo-fi,"" meaning ""Low Fidelity,"" adds that ""gritty"" and ""low quality"" sound that used to be all around us in the 90's and before. Now days, everything's HQ or HD, we have CDs instead of cassette tapes or vinyls, DVD players or online streaming instead of VHS players. I had a warm fuzzy feeling inside as I was creating this. It reminded me of my childhood, back when everything was ""ordinary"" and ""innocent.""

The word andante simply means ""moderately slow tempo."" Time has been moving way too fast for me, lately. It's time to take a little breather and refresh. Looking back, though tough, I had a really nice and a blessing of a childhood. Something that I'll never be able to relive and experience. I have to thank God for always being there, guiding me. Though I forget His presence and though I sometimes lose track of where I'm suppose to go, He never failed to show me His grace and patient love. I wish I could be more loving and caring like Him. I wish I could be a better friend to my friends. I wish I could be a better person. But the day of sunrise is nigh. Thank you to everyone who's been talking to me and checking up on me. Thank you for even sending me some encouraging words regarding music or life. I appreciate every one of you guys, supporting me in my musical endeavors.

i'll be dancing in a field
i'll take all the pain

i'll do anything

like a fucking arrow,
you shoot right through me..
heart's splayed out in the open,
i just wanna bleed..
let me bleed right out,
i don't really mind
just as long as you're around
and you find the time..

feed my bones to the dogs,
that you lay with
be gentle with my body, 
and my skin

dig up a grave for me to fit in,
just dump me in..
you don't have to say another word,
i already did

we‚Äôve been dating for a year and a half now
it‚Äôs time I spoke about the way that I feel
and yes, I think about the future we‚Äôll have but
how can I be certain your love for me is real

girl, I‚Äôm ready to commit, to get closer
I‚Äôm dropping hints, I‚Äôve got the question rehearsed
but there‚Äôs one little thing I‚Äôve got to get over
there‚Äôs just one little favor you‚Äôve got to do me first

And if you let me, baby,
you can start the countdown

All you‚Äôve gotta do for me, my darling
is ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 

it‚Äôs been weeks since when I first popped the question 
pulled the ring out and then spoke from the heart
you were sobbing and I don‚Äôt think that you heard me, 
don‚Äôt think that you realized my proposal had two parts

now we‚Äôre walking hand in hand to the altar
I‚Äôve gotta tell you, you look perfect in that dress
and yes, I love you babe, in sickness and in health but
before I say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù to you, I‚Äôve got one last request

n‚Äô I‚Äôm so happy, babe,
to have you as my spouse now,

but first, before our vows you‚Äôve gotta vow to me 
you‚Äôll ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 

so we did it, took the plunge into wedlock
you were waiting till‚Äô the both of us got married
let‚Äôs get consummating, I could make your bed rock
but first, just pull your phone out, girl, before I pop your cherry

and if you let me baby, I could bring the house down
yes, I‚Äôll take you to pound town    
but in the name of love, amor  
I‚Äôve got a shameless plug before
I plug you
just ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) 

and don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre blameless
like you‚Äôre beyond my reproach
how much fucking work does it take to make a single playlist
or throw me a repost

I still remember when I fell for you, your smile
resembled that of Aphrodite‚Äôs, I wished I could call you mine
forever, now we‚Äôre man and wife and we‚Äôve made vows and walked the aisle 
I‚Äôd never thought that me and you would be here, soon to raise a child
together, I know this is special, we‚Äôve put in nine months of time
and effort, so before your water breaks I‚Äôve just got one last final question,
all I need‚Äôs your soundcloud information, you can type the letters,
babe, I know you‚Äôre close just hold your labor off till I press enter,

and you see that orange button?
there‚Äôs no need to be reluctant 
all you‚Äôve gotta do is click the mouse down
it would mean so much to me, my baby

you sent me a text at 3:07 late last night

 you had  a few drinks

as if that could  make things right

and soon you asked  about our future

I hope you get stage IV cancer

 till your sweet goodbye, my friend

and I‚Äôll stay angry

LYRICS:
i'm sick of trembling in fear at the idea of death
since it's always on my mind i just hide in my bed
""everybody's scared of it"" is what my therapist said
but my case seems worse, when i've barely been fed

because the kitchen's too far to desire the steps
it'd take to make it down the stairs and try to find a baguette
or something similar that wouldn't make my stomach upset
it doesn't feel like this is real, yeah, my mind is a mess

the only times it seems clear is when music is played
some relatable creator says i'll soon be okay
or when reading poetry trying to soothe the dismay
and i can lose my insecurities in cute little sayings, like

""why frown when the sun goes down,
if you'll wake in the morning to such nice sounds
when the nighttime creeps, well your eyes might weep
but that's just moonlight tryna find nice people""

""why frown when the sun comes 'round
even if you feel shaken or upside down
when the daytime hits, you'll be great, my friend
just make it through this, just make it through this""

LYRICS:
we all got internet personas
internet personas we hide behind
we hide behind

we all got demons deep inside us
demons deep inside us we try to hide
we try to hide

i forgot who it is i truly am long ago
but i'll keep searching for it while i can

i knew a boy who could outline a shape in a second
that's display was eclectic in a way that was second to none
he had a hand than swam like fish in the seas
and a penstroke that'd bring any critic to his knees
it was beautiful, flowing like the blood inside my artieries
he painted hearts as targets and was practicing his archery
mastering the artistry he carried in his chest
until at best it was a godsend, and worst, it was a part of me
'til suddenly... things began to seem different
moods dissipated into blue and grey pigments
but surface-wise his screen names were never inefficient
as a method to communicate that happiness was with him
so a couple thousand people saw a perfectly inoccuous complexion
while i was tryna talk him through depression
the lesson to be learned is that your heros aren't invincible
just normal folks who often need expression, so pause and leave a message...

if you want; they'd probably appreciate it...

...internet personas
internet personas we hide behind
we hide behind

we all got demons deep inside us
demons deep inside that we try to hide
we try to hide

i forgot who it is i truly am long ago
but i'll keep searching for it while i can

i knew a person who could cultivate the words that they aligned
in a way that could coerce a train to fly
a perfect state of mind in which to learn creative rhymes
until their person was emburdened by the verses they designed
and they began to lose their touch...
the little quirks in all their writing became terse and uninviting
and ingesting any lettering they surgeoned into life
instead of being entertainment was inert and just absurd and all the work was fucking tiring
and suddenly... they were writing less and less
in spite of their success they saw no light and second guessed
the creativity they harbored in their heart
there's only so much fucking artwork you can make 'til you forget the way to start
so a couple million people saw some dipping in the frequency
of music while they fought idiosyncracy
that slept as mental illness... and woke as some peculiar train of thought
that masqueraded as a symptom of a hindering deliquency

i hope that all these words have made you think of me

We then quickly began to work on a project together which we called ""springtime in prague."" one of the main things we loved about instrumental hip hop was that it can transport you to somewhere else and can truly be the soundtrack to your life. 

now 9 months later we release the 2nd installment of our joint efforts. we lovingly present to you ""winter in kyoto"" an lp. we hope this takes you exactly where you want to go. 

so fucking thankful to everyone that listens. so much love.

Let it.

I just wanna keep you with me

You cannot move fast enough
I can move lots faster
I just wanna keep you with me
Parts of you
You cannot move fast enough
You cant outrun what I got for you

I could watch you sleep for hours
Do you know I'm watching
You never had an option
Primal instinct, to you
This is how I function
Oh you're not the first one
Oh I keep em coming

I can see what you need
Second story rain pouring cold out standing on a balcony
Not too far from me
You can't see what you need
I keep moving quiet, closer closer closer till I finally feel your heat
I am not your enemy
Do you understand my motive
Do you understand my thought
Do you know what I'm holding
I can bring it closer
I could bring it to the next stage
This is not how you want it
This is all how I wanted
I keep moving till I got you

Lyrics:
I am so lost 
In this world 
World of thoughts 

I am so lost 
In my heart 
you don't even know 
Heart why haven't you 
rescued my thoughts 

Cause i don't know 
I don't know 

I need to clear my mind 
I need to clear my mind 
I need to clear my mind 
I need to clear my mind 

Why haven't you gone away 
You are such a headache 

I don't know 
what to do 
When I am so 
Afraid of you 

I need to clear my mind 
I need to clear my mind 
I need to clear my mind 
I need to clear my mind

It‚Äôs been a year and 3 months since the foreigner arrived at the Land of the Samurai.

The epic sequel continues where our young hero Rai is on a quest to find his way back home and regain his memories that he once lost. Learning the way of the samurai, Rai has become highly skilled in his swordsmanship under the tutelage of Hachiro Sensei. Rai has matured but understands that there is plenty more room for growth. During this time on top of the vibrant Yama no aki, Hachiro reveals some clues in regards to how he can return home.


He explains that in order for him to go back home, he would have to face the shogun of this land in a 1-on-1 duel. That‚Äôs all he is able to share, but what Hachiro and Rai don‚Äôt know is that the shogun is also a foreigner and as to who the foreigner is, well‚Ä¶it happens to be Rai brother.

A tale about a foreigner who woke up in a mysterious land covered in mist.

As he was looking at his surroundings he bumped into a kid named Riku who had a broken wooden sword, Riku was excited because he'd never met a foreigner before. Riku later invited him to his home and the foreigner met his family but...this was no ordinary family as they were Samurais. 

As the foreigner peeked through the branchy hut he saw a dozen more just like Riku‚Äôs family, it was at that moment he realised he was in the Land of the Samurai.....

about a guy that sucks

sometimes i feel like i just wanna go back to my old ways
you‚Äôre telling me I‚Äôm silly it‚Äôs no fun in the old days

i‚Äôm such a romantic
i never remember
how things really happen
i guess you‚Äôre attractive

or something

live in the moment
thats what they tell me 
but what ever happened
to when you would hold me
and hold me
and hold me

girlfriend or girl thats a friend?
it‚Äôs easy just to pretend
we don‚Äôt have something real
its just how we feel

i'm feelin' something right x6

i wanna be the one you think about at night
and i wanna be the one that you would put up a fight 
for

that even when you‚Äôre bored

track 2 of long days.short years | may 2017

inspired by a poem by nickki nguyen:

when you're waiting for something, or someone, you wrestle with this feeling of uncertainty and hopelessness. 
your days grow longer because you're just going through the motions and looping through the same unanswered questions, the same thoughts over and over. 
the worst part is that I didn't even realize I was doing it until it all came crashing down on me. 
i followed someone onto a train, but i didn't want to get off without him. 
so I waited. 
i grew impatient, anxious and unhappy. 
will it be this stop? 
or the next? 
maybe the one after. 
i kept hoping to get off. 
it's no wonder i didn't enjoy the actual train ride.
i didn't sit and look out the window and watch the world speed by. 
instead, i stared at the exit and the growing gap between me and him. 
in the end, i couldn't wait anymore. 
i got off.

long days without you here
short years with you there

LYRICS:
we all got internet personas
internet personas we hide behind
we hide behind

we all got demons deep inside us
demons deep inside us we try to hide
we try to hide

i forgot who it is i truly am long ago
but i'll keep searching for it while i can

i knew a boy who could outline a shape in a second
that's display was eclectic in a way that was second to none
he had a hand than swam like fish in the seas
and a penstroke that'd bring any critic to his knees
it was beautiful, flowing like the blood inside my artieries
he painted hearts as targets and was practicing his archery
mastering the artistry he carried in his chest
until at best it was a godsend, and worst, it was a part of me
'til suddenly... things began to seem different
moods dissipated into blue and grey pigments
but surface-wise his screen names were never inefficient
as a method to communicate that happiness was with him
so a couple thousand people saw a perfectly inoccuous complexion
while i was tryna talk him through depression
the lesson to be learned is that your heros aren't invincible
just normal folks who often need expression, so pause and leave a message...

if you want; they'd probably appreciate it...

...internet personas
internet personas we hide behind
we hide behind

we all got demons deep inside us
demons deep inside that we try to hide
we try to hide

i forgot who it is i truly am long ago
but i'll keep searching for it while i can

i knew a person who could cultivate the words that they aligned
in a way that could coerce a train to fly
a perfect state of mind in which to learn creative rhymes
until their person was emburdened by the verses they designed
and they began to lose their touch...
the little quirks in all their writing became terse and uninviting
and ingesting any lettering they surgeoned into life
instead of being entertainment was inert and just absurd and all the work was fucking tiring
and suddenly... they were writing less and less
in spite of their success they saw no light and second guessed
the creativity they harbored in their heart
there's only so much fucking artwork you can make 'til you forget the way to start
so a couple million people saw some dipping in the frequency
of music while they fought idiosyncracy
that slept as mental illness... and woke as some peculiar train of thought
that masqueraded as a symptom of a hindering deliquency

i hope that all these words have made you think of me

Eliza Noble and Jennifer Skillman are Eli & Fur: the British live act, singer-songwriter and producer duo whose career together stretches back for nearly a decade. Having formed a close bond in their teens born out of their unwavering passion for music in all its guises, their careers as DJs, songwriters, vocalists and producers has taken them around the globe as touring musicians and seen them grace the stages of the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella, Tomorrowland and Glastonbury. 

‚ÄòFound In The Wild‚Äô is the pair‚Äôs long-awaited studio debut which will be released this summer on seminal electronic imprint and long-time label home Anjunadeep on 25th June. A dual part album concept, ‚ÄòFound in The Wild‚Äô is a sonic presentation of two contrasting and quintessential parts of the unique Eli & Fur sound; two sides of the Eli & Fur which they are finally ready to share with the world, ‚ÄúWe wanted to show both sides of us. We are quite varied in the way that we write music and so it made sense to have two parts living side by side. Everything we really love is on the album and we‚Äôre super proud of how it‚Äôs come together‚Äù. 

The first half of the album ‚ÄòFound‚Äô is a collection of song-based productions which show Eli & Fur‚Äôs strengths as songwriters, vocalists and producers in equal measure. Having begun their careers as songwriters at renowned production house Xenomania writing hits for pop acts like Girls Aloud, Eli & Fur‚Äôs talents as songwriters are abundantly clear. 

Released today, ‚ÄòWild Skies‚Äô is taken from the ‚ÄòFound‚Äô collection - a sensual and otherworldly ensemble which glues the duo‚Äôs trademark textured sound palette together perfectly. ""Wild Skies came together so organically and naturally. I felt like I was expressing myself without even really realising how and the melodies just fell out of me. A lot of the time, I‚Äôll write lyrics before the song, but with this one there was no preparation whatsoever, I just sat down at the computer with the microphone and sung, and that was that!‚Äù (Fur).  

The second half of the LP ‚ÄòIn the Wild‚Äô is a change in gear conceptually and ventures into the more upbeat, clubbier side of the project - these tracks explore the girls‚Äô penchant for emotive productions geared for the dancefloor which find the sweet spot between the dark and the emotive, marrying evocative vocals written around their own experiences as young musicians with their unique brand of euphoric club cuts. Presented side by side as ‚ÄòFound In The Wild‚Äô, the first album from Eli & Fur shows the artists at their most assured.

About College Music:
At College Music, we find and showcase the latest work from up and coming artists. Whether you're about to go out, having a party or just relaxing; we aim to represent something exciting, attractive and inviting. The name originated because a small group of friends while at college struggled to find music which had originality and didn't conform to the generic ""pop"" which was consistently released to the public. College Music is about new music from unheard artists and providing a platform for them to be heard by listeners like us. We firmly believe that a brand‚Äôs name, ethos, and content should all align together. For us, our name ties in perfectly.",47.0,False,0.0,,4078.0,https://soundcloud.com/collegemusicyt/afternoon,307591.0,98

lyrics by teddy @tddybrr

look its been a hard year,
and its on my mind,
now that all my fight's been diminished,
still think you should be here,
after all this time,
you're the only thing on my wishlist

look its been a hard year,
and its on my mind,
now that all my fight's been diminished,
and i used to think that,
if it went as planned,
id be dead to you by christmas,

but after all was said,
and we both were done,
we learned it was wrong to dismiss this,
cause I need the love during week,
and our love's getting weak,
to be travelling this distance,

look its been a hard year,
and its on my mind,
now that all my fight's been diminished,
still think you should be here,
after all this time,
you're the only thing on my wishlist",119.0,False,0.0,Alternative Rock,5665.0,https://soundcloud.com/suicidepart2/dead-by-christmas,262298.0,984

Lyrics:

Hook

Dont stay awake for too long
Dont go to bed
Ill make a cup of coffee for your head
Ill get u up and going out of bed

v1
I don‚Äôt wanna fall asleep
I don‚Äôt wanna pass away
Thinking of r future cuz 
Ill never see those days

I don‚Äôt know why this has happened
But I probably deserve it
I tried to do my best
But u know that I‚Äôm not perfect

Ive been praying for forgiveness
you‚Äôve been praying for my health
when I leave this earth
Hoping you‚Äôll find somebody else

Cuz ya we still young
Theres so much we haven‚Äôt done
Getting married
Start a family
Watch ur husband with his son

I wish it could be me
But I won‚Äôt make it off this bed
Hope I go to heaven so I see u once again

Ya my life was kind of short
But I got so many blessings
happy u were mine 
it sucks that its all ending

v2
Im happy that u here w me
Sorry if I tear up
When me and u were younger
U would always make me cheer up

taking goofy videos
And walking through the park
U would jump into my arms 
Every time u heard a bark

We would cuddle in your sheets
Sing me sound asleep
And sneak out through your kitchen at exactly 1:03

Sundays go to church
Mondays watch a movie
soon you‚Äôll be alone
Sorry that u have to loose me",33310.0,False,0.0,Lofihiphop,841880.0,https://soundcloud.com/powfu/death-bed-prod-otterpop,54430718.0,26154

Thanks to everyone who gave love to ""the days are just packed"", it means a lot to us. A few updates:
1. collab tape with @boppersboppers coming soon
2. new logo/cover photo/cover art out now. I chose an elephant because the first time i picked up a Calvin and Hobbes book, the first story was about Calvin turning himself into an elephant, as well as the fact that my favorite childhood movie was Babar, and lastly because I'm quite chubby in real life. It just seemed like the perfect thing to represent my music. Most of my art is done by De'Angelo Galvan. 
3. I have some experimental solo stuff coming soon. I've been real busy with life but I want to try to push beyond the boundaries of my own music and make something new and interesting.
