691161779,sempagula,the moon,,"wheres my face . ? I'm a ghost that never did any drugs. as Dali once said, "" I dont do drugs, I am drugs..."" you'll see what I mean. seriously I'm a synesthesia producing dynamic supra human dancer for one thing. on another, I've literally had deep conversations with junkies that hung around too long regardless of me not doing their dope... they feed off my aura. happy with my ""smell"" nearby and not - junk crazier craving wise as soon as I left the space. I've noticed it happen with everyone else too. women like it when I dont shower as long as I eat right. like a skunk. no meat no onions. I did experience 5.5 years of college and have degrees in biochemistry and religious studies. i know what a drug and a natural substance is. it's just harder to talk about anything outside the ""normal lie"" this culture calls reality unless it's a drug user, that's not totally a zombie, unless; the zombification somehow made it more intelligent because no one told it what to do. the zombie just told itself to be smart in a drug induced frenzy that was too strong not to physically change the brain structure. and it happened. everybody is different, we are all the same.
 substances need to be re-explained. too much slavery. you dont get this. stand up walk around, smell the flowers. and then go why the fuck arnt their more flowers everywhere (the kkk burned the flower that made the california mountains purple, the chumash used it to get high and walk all happy and horny)... ( o and shot all the bears in some battle ritual cause they all fat homos but fucking thinking they from Rome still snuffing anybody they dont like.)  ...   aaaand I'm hungry . why doesnt my neighbor have a tree next to the side walk so I can go find freshly fallen fruit the tree gave me this mornin? like this place just east of the garden of eden all around us...  or just leave it for the flies and have a tea, they have to eat to. and they utilize the whole thing for a house too. get it? fallen fruit is a house for some bugs. then they transform and it's all gross and magical... 

wish you knew who grew earth? how stupid are you ? it was the flies, the bees, the worms, the bugs - every other form of life before some dipshits(they dont know poo, they dont know blue.)  decided to live exclusively off the cow... fuck em. till death do us part never again you rapist bastards. 

your only them by assimilation in order to survive. we are all trapped here. no one survives in the end. except for those who are already dead, unique. it's kinda like that deadpool movie where he keeps stopping the kid from killing as if it's a good thing to do... but instead he just goes "" ya know what kid? you have a brain. go ahead and burn that christian man who raped you religiously since day three and everyone he knows and everyone of his houses and everything they stand for till theres nothing left but ashes on my face! because, I'm already dead. "" seriously tired of being deaf, blind, and mute, and however still wiser, more intelligent, and just all around better than any one of you fatsos. . . ( I can eat pizza everyday and not get fat because i choose vegan cheese...)

just because you lack the ability or intelligence to communicate with the birds and the bees doesnt mean that I do. it's a mind to mind sort of situation. 
I know that I know nothing, and therefore I can understand everything, given the right time context and perspective...

32570390,Neonn Felicity 🎃,"Sacramento, CA",,"🦋 rave philosopher 🍄 author of a forthcoming psychedelic political philosophy book 🦉 host/curator of Utopian Cartography, a podcast & music blog 🔮 Scope the website for hundreds of epic conscious Hip-Hop albums, ever-updating video playlists organized by topic, & much more evolutionary media.

In the next month or so I'll be relaunching the Utopian Cartography podcast with an interview with Benji Hannus aka Secret Recipe, the genius producer & DJ & co-curator of Wormhole Entertainment & Wormhole Music Group. Then we've got an awesome slate of guests after that, including the futuristic 4D visual artist & VJ Matthew Childers aka Digital Introspect, the surrealist provocateur go-go clown Kris Kaufeldt aka White Tiger, & the woke psy-rap poet Cosmo from the group Hippy Trap. Subscribe on YouTube or your favorite podcast platform; links are all on UtopianCartography.com ▲

🔮

A podcast for a positive future! To host fun conversations to illuminate the path out of this oppressive leviathan, towards an ideal society.

Terence McKenna once said, ""If we continue going where we're headed, we'll end up living in a toxic waste dump ruled over by Nazis."" 30 years later, we are still driving down that same road. How do we escape this fate? Is there another path? 

If we are going to escape our default dystopian trajectory, we need a map. Reactionary forces in our society are afraid of the unknowable future, so they vociferously grasp towards an unrecoverable romanticized past, for lack of an alternative vision. The status quo has become untenable, so something has to give. We forward-thinkers must get better at articulating the future we want to see, otherwise we will slide back into the worst aspects of historical injustice, and things will get very ugly indeed.

To create a world worth living in, we need help. No one can create the future alone. Whatever the fate of our species will be, it will be a manifestation of our collective will. The people own the future. It does not belong to any elite. But most people don't even bother confronting the future, because they are kept treading water by an economic system that treats them as mere instruments of production. The working class is deliberately distracted from thinking about big picture questions like Does it really have to be this way? What is the good life? How should society be organized? What would we do with our time if money was no object? What does utopia look like from here? and How the fuck do we really accelerate the evolutionary path towards it?

Utopian Cartography will feature artists, activists, intellectuals, & event producers from whom I have gained great insights about the potential of a positive future. When I woke up to the ways of the world years ago, I became overwhelmingly depressed by the apocalypse. I was convinced we were headed straight for the Nazi toxic waste dump Terence warned us about. Then I discovered utopia. My eyes were opened yet further, and I learned that the revelations of our as yet unrealized liberation had a purpose. I came to appreciate the fact that ""change only occurs when the pain of staying the same outweighs the pain of changing."" Apocalypse is a necessary precursor to utopia. We can only see the garden beyond the veil by first confronting the ills of the status quo. Utopia is out there, if only we know how and where to look.

So if you want to shed some of that existential despair and pessimism about the possibility of a good future for humanity and our planet, give this show a listen. We will do our best to illustrate the rational case for optimism about the future, with a philosophically & historically informed evolutionary perspective, streetwise cynicism, and a healthy dose of psychedelic trickster irreverence. 

To be hopeless is to disregard history. The future can be better than any of us imagine, so let's figure out how to get there.

With Love, 

Neonn Felicity 💜",453,1978,12886,698,https://soundcloud.com/utopiancartography,475,65
